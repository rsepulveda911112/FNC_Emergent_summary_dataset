{"Id_Article": 411, "claim": "UPDATE: Children used as dogs in fights", "summary": ["The nation awoke this morning (Monday) to headlines of children imitating dogs in fights at a local school and, unfortunately, the story seems to be true.While the Addie cannot name the school or those involved as they are all minors, the paper can confirm that, according to Wendy Wilson of the NSPCA, the organisation was called in, in June to handle this situation.When they arrived at the school to investigate, Wendy says she witnessed the children fighting so there can be no doubt that the fights were taking place.While the NSPCA is unsure how long the fighting had been taking place before they were alerted to this cruel \u201cgame\u201d Wendy has confirmed that the NSPCA was contacted by the Springs SPCA last June to make her aware of children at a Springs school imitating dog fights.However, when contacted for comment, Celeste Kleyn, manager from the Springs Springs SPCA, says they are not aware of the incidents.\u201cOur investigations revealed that the children were engaging in both real dog fighting activities outside of school hours as well as role play whilst at school,\u201d says Wendy.\u201cAnimals fighting always results in animals being harmed and suffering no matter the level of sophistication it is taking place at.\u201cThe issue was brought to our attention by a very observant and proactive principal as there are animal victims involved as well,\u201d Wendy commented adding, \u201c\u201dThe SPCAs mandate is to ensure the welfare of animals as well as their protection.\u201cWere there is animal abuse of this nature you will find co-current abuses of vulnerable humans.\u201dAll the children involved in this situation are of primary school age, and investigations indicated that all these children were first exposed to the activity of dog fighting by either older children or adults in the community during their primary school years.According to Wendy, this is the first time she or her colleagues have come across this type of \u201cdog fighting\u201d with humans acting as the dogs.The NSPCA brought the situation to the attention of the different SAPS Units and Social Services and workshops were conducted with invitations extended to local SAPS, Social Services, Child Protection, Department of Justice, Community leaders, School Principals and local SPCAs.These workshops addressed aspects such as recognising animal cruelty and the link that it has with violence towards humans, dog fighting and other organised animal crime, animal cruelty and children, societies role and responsibility with regards to animal protection in South Africa.Wendy says that the principle ensured the NSPCA that the fighting role play had been stopped at the school but, she says, the children could still be engaging in the activity outside of school hours.When asked about the adults involved, Wendy said that the adults organising the fights are all members of the immediate community and are known dog fighters in the community.She says the children are forced to watch dogs fighting over weekends and then, once at school, are forced to re-enact the fights.The children are also encouraged to bet on the outcome of these fights involving children going down on all fours, growling and snapping at one another, and in some instances injuring one another.Further, it is believed that the prize, for the winning child fighter, is a younger child with whom they are encouraged to \u201cmate\u201d.The truth of this is, however, unclear as Webdy comments: \u201cI saw the act of canine copulation enacted but I do not know how far this is taken when the children are alone.\u201cAs I understand it from the children, different children are used as the female dogs but most often it tends to be the younger ones who are forced into this role.\u201dCaptain Johannes Ramphora, spokesperson for the Springs police told the Addie that he unaware of this situation and whether or not the police are involved in an investigation into the matter."], "label": "agree"}
