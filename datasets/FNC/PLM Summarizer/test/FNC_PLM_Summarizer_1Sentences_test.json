Office of U.S._Marine_Corps_Communication_Phone : 703-614-4309 Ontherecord@USMC.MIL_So how come Kelly was letting her Fox_News guests hold forth on a debunked rumor , three hours later ? \" We are surrendering our embassy , \" Hegseth told her . \" And now we are asking U.S._Marines to surrender their dignity , give up oaths they made , creeds that they lived by , and surrender their rifle . \" Retired Gen._Jack_Keane added : \" This is a mindless stupid bureaucrat making a decision like that offensive to military culture , offensive to procedures . \" It 's probably helpful to know a little bit of background about those guests . Hegseth , who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican_for_Senate in Minnesota awhile back , is an ex-Bear Stearns banker whose way through Princeton was paid in part by the conservative Family_Research_Council . Since 2008 , he 's made six figures chairing astroturfed veterans ' groups for GOP causes , and has been a seven-figure bag man for political donations from Republican billionaire Sheldon_Adelson . He 's on call whenever Republicans need a military vet to blast liberals , even_though his own track record of strategic prognostications includes this gem : \" eliminating Saddam and liberating Iraq could be the ' Normandy_Invasion ' or ' fall of the Berlin_Wall ' of our generation \u2026 and there is equally encouraging evidence that republican principles could thrive there . \" Keane , for his part , cofounded and chaired a neoconservative propaganda front , the Institute_for_the_Study_of_War , with some of Dick_Cheney 's top geopolitical advisors , using it to rally support for the \" troop surge \" in Iraq . Since leaving the service in 2003 , he 's been a paid consultant for military contractors , including the company formerly known as Blackwater . He 's never met a costly military engagement he could not make costlier . Confronted with a combined force like this , the Marine_Corps did not stand a chance . [ Photo credit : Cpl .
