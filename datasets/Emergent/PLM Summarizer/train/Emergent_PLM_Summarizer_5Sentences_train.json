Cameron described 44-year-old Haines as a \" British hero \" , saying that \" his selflessness , his decency , his burning desire to help others has today cost him his life \" . Those who killed him \" are not Muslims , they are monsters \" , he said . Cameron repeated his support for US air strikes against IS in Iraq , and for President_Obama 's strategy to build a broad coalition to fight the jihadists . But despite growing calls at home for action against IS , Cameron made no commitment to Britain joining the air strikes . London began sending arms this week to Kurdish fighters battling IS militants in northern Iraq , but it has faced accusations of confusion over its strategy . During a visit to Berlin this week , Foreign_Secretary_Philip_Hammond said Britain would not take part in strikes against IS in Syria , after parliament last year voted against taking military action in that country . But just hours later , a spokesman for Cameron_'s_Downing_Street office insisted the prime minister was not ruling anything out . In the footage of Haines \u2019 s murder , a hooded militant blames Cameron for joining forces with the United_States and says the alliance will drag the British people into \" another bloody and unwinnable war \" . \u2018 Barbaric crime must not remain unpunished \u2019 In a statement , ACTED said it was \u201c deeply appalled and horrified \u201d by the murder . \u201c David was a new member of the ACTED team supporting the emergency humanitarian response for the displaced Syrian people in Atmeh camp near to the Turkish border , \u201d it said . \u201c David was appreciated by the ACTED team and all those around him , notably for his generosity , commitment , and his professionalism . \u201c The horrible assassination of David , an aid worker , goes against all humanitarian principles and is a crime against humanity . This barbaric crime must not remain unpunished . \u201d Before joining ACTED , Haines had also worked for groups such as Handicap_International , which helps the disabled during conflicts , and Nonviolent_Peaceforce , which sends unarmed peacekeepers into conflict zones . He had previously been in Libya during its civil war and South_Sudan . His brother , Mike_Haines , said he had also worked for the United_Nations in the Balkans \u201c helping people in real need \u201d . \u201c His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair , \u201d Mike Haines said . \u201c He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly . \u201d ( FRANCE 24 with AFP , AP ) Date created : 2014-09-14"], "label": "for"}
