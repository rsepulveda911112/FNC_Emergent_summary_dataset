The aerial photograph of Crabzilla was originally posted to Weird_Whitstable , a website dedicated to strange sightings in the Kent area , back in 2013 . The blog posted a second photo of crabzilla in July_2014 which showed two enormous crab claws reaching out of the water : This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken last weekend . The boys were unaware of the danger , but as several passersby shouted to them , the crab slipped silently away under the water , into the dark , sideways . Quinton_Winter , the curator of Weird_Whitstable , told the Express_Times that he was skeptical about the photos when he first saw them . That changed last summer , however , when he spotted the giant crab for himself : At first all I could see was some faint movement , then as it rose from the water I thought , ' that 's a funny looking bit of driftwood . ' It had glazed blank eyes on stalks , swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws .
