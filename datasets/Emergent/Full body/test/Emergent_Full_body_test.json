Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such an attack or on the militant leader being injured. Iraq's Defence and Interior ministries both issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without elaborating, and the news was broadcast on state-run television Sunday night. The reports came at a time when U.S. President Barack Obama said the U.S.-led coalition was in a position to start going on the offensive against the ISIS militants. Al-Baghdadi, believed to be in his early 40s, has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al-Qaida into an independent transnational military force. He has positioned himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community. His forces have seized large parts of Syria and Iraq, killed thousands of people, beheaded Westerners and drawn the U.S. troops and warplanes back into the region, where Washington is leading a campaign of airstrikes by a multinational coalition. An Interior Ministry intelligence official told The Associated Press that al-Baghdadi was wounded by an Iraqi airstrike that came during a meeting Saturday with militants in the town of Qaim. The official cited informants within the militant group. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded. U.S. also targeted ISIS leaders in weekend strikes The operation was carried out by Iraqi security forces, both officials said, although they did not know how seriously al-Baghdadi was hurt. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential material. A statement posted Sunday on the official Facebook page of Defence Minister Khalid Obeidi also said al-Baghdadi was wounded, but added that he was targeted in the northern city of Mosul, currently the group's biggest stronghold in Iraq. A senior U.S. defence official said Saturday that the coalition conducted a series of airstrikes targeting a gathering of ISIS leaders near Mosul, but he could not confirm whether al-Baghdadi was part of the gathering. Reports circulated Saturday that al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike, but there was no confirmation at that time from either U.S. or Iraqi officials. The U.S. Central Command said Friday it conducted two airstrikes near Qaim that destroyed a militant armoured vehicle and two checkpoints of the militant group, which is also known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS. On Nov. 1, the U.S. military conducted four strikes in the town. When asked about the Iraqi reports, Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder, spokesman for U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, said Sunday: \"We have no information to corroborate reports that ISIL leader al-Baghdadi has been injured.\" Rami Abdurrahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said some ISIS militants wounded in the airstrike near Qaim were taken across the frontier to the Syrian border town of Boukamal. \"They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital,\" Abdurrahman said. There was no indication that al-Baghdadi was among those brought to Boukamal. 'They brought ISIS injured to Aisha Hospital in Boukamal. We don't know if somebody died there or not. We know for sure that they brought some of the ISIS people injured in Roummaneh to the hospital.' - Rami Abdurrahman, director of Syrian Observatory for Human Rights The reclusive al-Baghdadi is known to have made only one public appearance, purportedly delivering a sermon at a mosque in Mosul, as seen in a video posted online in June. That came five days after his group declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territories it holds in Iraq and Syria. The group proclaimed al-Baghdadi its leader and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to him. Since then, part of the Islamic State group's core strategy has been to establish administration over lands that it controls to project an image of itself as more than just a fighting force. In parts of Syria under its control, the group administers courts, repairs roads and even polices traffic. It recently imposed a curriculum in schools in Mosul and in its Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, scrapping subjects such as philosophy and chemistry, and fine-tuning the sciences to fit with its ideology. As his forces swept across northern and western Iraq in June and July, they seized towns, causing several of Iraq's army and police divisions to fall into disarray in the worst crisis in the country since U.S. troops withdrew in 2011. Obama OKs more ground troops in Iraq On Friday, Obama authorized the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, which could boost the total number of U.S. forces to 3,100 and spread advisory teams and trainers across the country, including into Anbar province where the fighting has been fierce. The militant Islamist group has overrun a large part of the province in its push to expand its territory, which stands at about a third of both Iraq and Syria. Last week, hundreds of men, women and children with the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe were killed by the militant group, which apparently feared the tribe would challenge its authority in the province. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters shoot toward Baretle village, which is controlled by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), on the edge of Mosul, Iraq, on Sept. 8. Iraqi soldiers, joined by militia groups and backed by U.S. airstrikes, are fighting to keep the Sunni jihadist group from continuing its violent expansion across the region. 1 of 18 Officials with the Iraqi government, as well as officials with the coalition targeting the extremists, repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key elements in the fight against the Islamic State group since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to airstrikes and ground forces. In an interview with CBS' Face the Nation that took place Friday and was broadcast Sunday, Obama said its airstrikes, which the U.S. first launched on Aug. 8, have been effective in scaling back the Islamic State group's advance. \"Rather than just try to halt ISIL's momentum, we're now in a position to start going on some offence,\" Obama said. \"The airstrikes have been very effective in degrading ISIL's capabilities and slowing the advance that they were making,\" he added.", "label": "observing"}

There had previously been reports on social media that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi would make his first public appearance since his Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant changed its name to the Islamic State and declared him caliph. The Iraqi government denied that the video, which carried Friday's date, was credible. It was also not possible to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording or the date when it was made. Iraqi officials said Sunday that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS or Islamic State terror group, was wounded in a U.S.-led airstrike on a convoy of militants in Iraq, and a security strategist said the attack killed his close aide. While Pentagon officials said they cannot confirm whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy that was targeted, Iraq's Defense and Interior Ministries issued statements saying the ISIS leader had been wounded, according to The Associated Press. An Iraqi Interior Ministry intelligence official also cited informants within the terror group as saying that the ISIS leader was hit in the town of Qaim in Iraq's western Anbar province. Auf Abdulrahman Elefery, a \"very close companion\" of al-Baghdadi and also known as Abu Suja, was killed along with several other members of the ISIS when planes struck the group's convoy on Friday night, Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi security strategist, told The Telegraph. \"He and Baghdadi were rarely separate. It's for this reason that it could be possible that Baghdadi was with him [at the time of the attack],\" al-Hashimi was quoted as saying. \"There are more 20 other people were killed in the US air strike but they are not senior in the organization.\" Baghdadi was supposedly an Islamic preacher at the time of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. He later became a militant and was briefly detained by American forces at Camp Bucca, according to Defense Department officials. Baghdadi, who is in his early 40s and has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head, then allegedly met and received training from al-Qaeda operatives, and later became the leader of the ISIS. The U.S.-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes on ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria since August. On Friday, U.S.-led airstrikes destroyed a convoy of 10 armed trucks in the attacks on a gathering of ISIS leaders near Mosul. A Mosul morgue official said about 50 bodies of ISIS militants were brought to the facility after the airstrikes. The U.S. has now also doubled the number of its troops in Iraq to fight ISIS militants. While there are about 1,400 U.S. troops in Iraq, President Obama Friday authorized Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to send 1,500 more troops to train and assist Iraqi forces in fighting ISIS militants, as was requested by Iraq's government. ISIS, an al-Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL, now controls large parts of territories in Iraq and Syria, and seeks to form an Islamic emirate in the Levant region through \"jihad.\" ISIS is seen as the most brutal jihadist terror group. According to reports, U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, who have been beheaded by ISIS militants, were subjected to severe physical torture, including waterboarding, and a majority of them converted to Islam under duress.", "label": "observing"}

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hurt in the strikes today, according to local witnesses and government sources. Two witnesses confirmed that bombs had fallen on the town of al-Qaim, next to the Syrian border. Local government sources described how an aircraft had swooped over a meeting of senior ISIS figures and dropped its payload, killing more than a dozen people. Another witness said that eight people had died when a bomb struck a market. A local hospital was said to be overwhelmed with the volume of patients from the raid - including al-Baghdadi.

Al-Qaim and the neighbouring Syrian town of Albukamal are on a strategic supply route linking territory held by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The so-called Caliph, who declared himself leader of all the world's Muslims in a televised speech, was formerly a prisoner of the U.S. during their occupation of Iraq.

U.S. officials would not confirm or deny whether Baghdadi, the group's overall leader, had been targeted, though one said that the coalition's airstrikes had not been targeting any particular meeting. IS-affiliated Twitter accounts rushed to deny the reports, with one tweeting: 'I can report to the Muslims that Amir Al-Momineen Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi Hafid hu'allah is alive and well.' Prisoner: al-Baghdadi, shown before his rise to power, was held as a prisoner by the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq The hardline Sunni Islamic State's drive to form a caliphate in the two countries has helped return sectarian violence in Iraq to the dark days of 2006-2007, the peak of its civil war. It has also created a cross-border sanctuary for Arab militants, as well as foreign fighters whose passports could allow them to evade detection in Western airports. The U.S. strikes coincide with violence elsewhere in Iraq, after jihadist-style attacks hit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. On Saturday night a car bomb killed eight people in Baghdad's mostly Shi'ite Sadr City, police and hospital sources said. The blasts bring to 28 the day's toll from bombs in the Iraqi capital and the western city of Ramadi. Two bombs exploded in separate attacks in Baghdad's mainly Shi'ite Amil district, said a police source. 'A driver parked his car and went to a cigarette stall, then he disappeared. Then his car blew up, killing passers-by,' the source said, describing one of the two attacks in Amil. In the mostly Shi'ite al-Amin area of Baghdad, another car bomb killed eight people, medical sources said. The attack by a suicide bomber on a checkpoint in Ramadi in Anbar killed five soldiers. 'Before the explosion, the checkpoint was targeted with several mortar rounds. Then the suicide humvee bomber attacked it,' said a police official. There was no claim of responsibility for the bombings, but they resembled operations carried out by Islamic militants. In the town of Baquba, 40 miles northeast of Baghdad, a gunman killed a Shi'ite militiaman, and a car bomb targeting a police officer killed his 10-year-old son, security sources said. Air strikes: The reports say that U.S. warplanes dropped bombs on the town of al-Qaim in Iraq. Pictured is an earlier strike against ISIS in Kobani, on the Turkey-Syria border Western and Iraqi officials say U.S.-led air strikes are not enough to defeat the al Qaeda offshoot and Iraq must improve the performance of its security forces to eliminate the threat from the group, which wants to redraw the map of the Middle East. President Barack Obama has approved sending up to 1,500 more troops to Iraq, roughly doubling the number of U.S. forces on the ground, to advise and retrain Iraqis in their battle against Islamic State. The Iraqi prime minister's media office said the additional U.S. trainers were welcome but the move, five months after Islamic State seized much of northern Iraq, was belated, state television reported. Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is the relatively discreet leader of the Islamic State extremist group. He used to play for his mosque's soccer team and has a PhD in Islamic history. But after spending four years in a US camp during the Iraq occupation, he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world. The government placed a $10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous. This warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning. He maintained a low profile for months as ISIS, the group's original name, rose to global infamy and Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'. But he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the first week of July this year. Born Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarri in 1971 near Samarra, Iraq, he came from a Sufi family - a tolerant form of Islam. In the 1990s, he completed a PhD in Baghdad and played soccer with friends. But he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to Anbar province where he joined Sunni groups protesting the US occupation. American forces detained Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion. He was released when the camp closed in 2009. He was thought to be 'bad but not the worst' sources told The Daily Beast. But he then joined the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria, and rose up the ranks rapidly. After allegedly killing the leader, Abu Omar Baghdadi, he took hold of the terror group. The United States spent $25billion on the Iraqi military during the U.S. occupation that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 and triggered an insurgency that included al Qaeda. Washington wants Iraq's Shi'ite-led government to revive an alliance with Sunni tribesmen in Anbar province which helped U.S. Marines defeat al Qaeda. Such an alliance would face a more formidable enemy in Islamic State, which has more firepower and funding.

I wonder if al-Baghdadi is doing the same. It would certainly suit him to play dead for a while - plus, he's risen from beyond the grave before. Even now, the Pentagon is seeking to confirm whether coalition air strikes have critically injured or even managed to kill the elusive \u2018caliph\u2019 \u2013 and we are none the wiser. Could it be telling that the news of his death apparently leaked out from ISIS itself? So far, U.S. officials are working on inference. Late on Friday night, American warplanes hit a ten-car convoy southwest of Mosul, which functions as ISIS\u2019s capital in northern Iraq. Among the 20 people thought to have been killed was Auf Abdulrahman Elefery, who is known by his code name Abu Sajar, a key aide to Baghdadi. If Abu Sajar was there, it is likely that Baghdadi was too, though he may also be among the casualties who were rushed to Mosul hospitals, where there were urgent appeals over loudspeakers for blood donations. According to Iraqi sources, parallel attacks on Qaim in Anbar province killed one of the terror group's top strategists in a predominantly Sunni region where ISIS has made huge military advances in recent weeks as the world\u2019s attention was distracted by its relentless siege of Kobane in northern Syria. Normally so effusive on social media, ISIS are being strangely coy about the losses it may have sustained this weekend, though it has started arresting former members of the Iraqi army lest they are providing the US with actionable intelligence. ISIS is probably scouring their deep substitute bench for replacements for anyone killed, including Baghdadi himself. Baghdadi has made a lifelong virtue of anonymity, especially since his Al Qaeda mentor, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. bombing raid in 2006. Except for his brief appearance in Mosul in July to proclaim himself Caliph (an office that fuses political and religious leadership), Baghdadi has kept a low profile, so that the fate of ISIS does not appear to hinge on his personal survival. It also offers the perfect cover should Baghdadi wish to disappear for a while, Homeland-style. For Baghdadi has been careful to organize ISIS in such a way that power is highly decentralised, with a clear division between those responsible for administering territories the terror group controls and those who direct its military operations. ISIS has been careful to include many Sunni tribal figures in administration, precisely to pre-empt any U.S. attempt to trigger a tribal uprising against them, a strategy the Americans pursued against Al Qaeda in Iraq (ISIS\u2019s forerunner) in 2007-08 with some success. Targeted: Baghdadi was reportedly wounded on Friday night when American warplanes hit a ten-car ISIS convoy like this one southwest of Mosul, which functions as ISIS's capital in northern Iraq (file picture) ISIS\u2019s military command includes at least two Sunni Muslim Iraqi army generals on the run since the Saddam era, who clearly have considerable tactical ability. ISIS has used lightning advances and exemplary terror as well as suicide bombers to destroy enemy command and control centres. They also use the destruction of bridges and controlled flooding to shape battlefields to their choosing, and the deployment of roadside bombs and embedded tanks to inhibit countermoves by their Iraqi or Kurdish opponents. So far, the U.S. response has been to remove the unpopular Shia prime minister of Iraq, to reduce the alienation of the country\u2019s Sunni and limited efforts to restore the fighting morale of the Iraqi national army, which, poorly led, effectively fled from this ferocious opponent. The only effective obstacles to ISIS taking over the country have been Shia militias in Baghdad and further south, and the Kurdish peshmerga in the north. Although the U.S. has added a further 1,500 military advisers, bringing their total strength to over 3000, they have to be careful since the same Shia militias are restive about a renewed U.S. \u2018occupation\u2019 of Iraq. American airstrikes have been criticised as a drizzle when what is required resembles a cloud burst in a thunder storm. So far there have been an average of five strikes a day, compared with 50 in Libya in 2011, 85 in Afghanistan, and 800 a day in Iraq itself during the 2003 US-led invasion. So far, only 800 of the 3, 200 sorties over Iraq and Syria have actually involved dropping bombs or firing missiles. Until these raids at the weekend, there has been an absence of actionable intelligence from the ground, while Pentagon lawyers are being ultra cautious about avoiding any civilian casualties. The long distance planes have to fly from bases in Qatar or the UAE, or from carriers in the Persian Gulf, also makes it hard for them to loiter looking for targets of opportunity. So while it would be a significant blow to ISIS to lose its self-styled Caliph, he is replaceable in what in practice is a collective leadership with many experienced and hardened personalities. And he may yet rise from \u2018the dead\u2019.", "label": "for"}

Since then, they surrounded the refinery and halted its production, while a detachment of government troops inside has held out for months under siege.

American defence officials confirmed that the air strikes on Friday night destroyed 10 armoured vehicles near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, and that the mission had been \"against what was assessed to be a gathering of [Isis] leaders\". Iraqi state television and two officials also said yesterday that the Isis leader had been wounded. An Interior Ministry official and a senior Iraqi military official both told the Associated Press that the strike on Saturday had wounded Baghdadi, but gave no details about how bad his injuries might be, following speculation about his death. The death of the elusive leader would mark a significant step change in the US-led effort to curtail the Islamist extremist group. Among those reportedly confirmed killed in the strikes was Abdul Rahman al-Athaee, also known as Abu Saja, one of al-Baghdadi's key aides and a man who regularly travelled with the militant group's self-proclaimed \"caliph\" or spiritual leader. But while the Al Arabiya News Channel quoted local tribal sources as saying that al-Baghdadi was \"critically wounded\" in the attack, neither US nor Iraqi officials were able to provide further details. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this morning, Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton discussed al-Baghdadi's \"potential death\", suggesting the UK is confident there is at least a strong chance the Isis leader may have been successfully targeted. Gen Houghton said he could not \"absolutely confirm\" that al-Baghdadi was in the convoy, but warned that the terror group's leadership would \"regenerate\" regardless of his fate. \"What I wouldn't want to do is rush to the sense that the potential death of one of their totemic leaders is going to create some strategic reverse in Isis,\" he said. The Pentagon has released a statement saying that it \"cannot confirm if [Isis] leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present\", nonetheless adding that the strikes as a whole \"demonstrate the pressure we continue to place on the IS terrorist network\".

Photo: AP The US-led coalition unleashed airstrikes near the Iraqi city of Mosul targeting top jihadist militants but the fate of the Islamic State group's enigmatic leader remained unclear. Claims swirled that hardline IS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed in the attacks late Friday, but US officials could not confirm if he had even been present. The news came after US President Barack Obama unveiled plans to send up to 1500 more US troops to Iraq to help battle the militants who have seized a large swathe of territory. In fresh violence, some 33 people were killed in a wave of car bombings against Shiite areas in the capital Baghdad, highlighting again the security challenge facing Iraqis even within government-controlled zones. US Central Command confirmed that coalition aircraft conducted a \"series of airstrikes\" against \"a gathering of ISIL leaders near Mosul\". A convoy of 10 armoured vehicles from the group also known as ISIL was destroyed. \"We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present,\" CENTCOM spokesman Patrick Ryder said in his statement. A strike against Baghdadi, who has proclaimed himself the \"caliph\" of a state straddling Iraq and Syria, would be a major coup for the US-led coalition. Washington has offered a $US10 million ($10.82 million) reward for his capture, and some analysts say he is increasingly seen as more powerful than al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri. In a video posted online in July, purportedly the first known footage of Baghdadi, he ordered all Muslims to obey him during a Ramadan sermon in Mosul. Al-Arabiya TV reported Baghdadi had been wounded, while a local Iraqi channel said one of his aides was killed. Iraqi leaders said the new US military trainers who will aid its fight against jihadists are welcome, but come \"late\". Ryder added the US-led strikes were a further sign of \"the pressure we continue to place on the ISIL terrorist network\". The aim was to squeeze the group and ensure it had \"increasingly limited freedom to manoeuvre, communicate and command\". The new troops will roughly double the number of American soldiers already in the country and marks a deepening US commitment in the open-ended war. \"This step is a little late, but we welcome it,\" a statement from Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi's office said. The government had requested that members of the international coalition help train and arm its forces, the statement said. Multiple Iraqi army divisions collapsed in the early days of the jihadist northern offensive, leaving major units that need to be reconstituted. AFP", "label": "observing"}

The United States Central Command said coalition aircraft did conduct a series of airstrikes on a convoy in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul where it is thought there was a gathering of Islamic State leaders. It is believed there were at least 50 casualties from the attack. However Colonel Patrick Ryder, a spokesman at Central Command, said: \"We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present,\" the Guardian reported. One of Baghdadi's key aides, Abdul Rahman al-Athaee, is known to have died in the attack and as he was known to travel with the leadership it has prompted a raft of speculation as to the well-being of Baghdadi. A Twitter account purported to be run by an IS spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, appeared to confirm the self-declared caliph had been injured. \"Perhaps you suspected that the caliphate ended with martyrdom of the caliph. I assure the [Islamic] nation that the Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is well thank God, and I wish him a speedy recovery.\" However commentators have cast doubt on those comments, with some labelling the Twitter account a fake. Two people who say they witnessed an airstrike on a house near the western Iraqi border town of al-Qaim where senior Islamic State officials were meeting told Reuters the militants had evacuated a local hospital so their wounded could be treated. Meanwhile, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official told Associated Press on Sunday that the strike on al-Qaim in Anbar province had wounded Baghdadi, while a senior Iraqi military official also said he had heard Baghdadi had been wounded in the attack. Baghdadi's last public appearance was in a mosque in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in July, in which he declared himself the leader of a new caliphate that stretched from Syria into Iraq. One commentator and author, Juan Cole, cautioned against placing too much hope that \u2013 should the death of Baghdadi be confirmed \u2013 the Islamic State would be weakened. \"The US has killed a long line of al-Qaeda leaders by now, from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in 2006 to Bin Laden himself,\" Mr Cole wrote on his Informed Comment blog on Sunday. \"The military's theory that leadership is rare and attrition wrought on leaders is decisive in defeating a group is simply incorrect. ISIL's toolbox of terrorising and coercing people is available to large numbers of people.\" Britain's chief of defence staff, General Sir Nick Houghton, also warned that Islamic State would regroup if its leader had been killed. Speaking to the BBC, General Houghton said: \"What I wouldn't want to do is rush to the sense that the potential death of one of their totemic leaders is going to create some strategic reverse within [IS]. \"They will regenerate leadership \u2026 because of the current potential attractiveness of this warped ideology.

A senior Iraqi official confirmed to the Guardian that the aide, Abdur Rahman al-Athaee, also known as Abu Sajar, was killed in the the attack late on Friday night, which hit a 10-car convoy southwest of the Isis stronghold. Athaee was known to have been in almost constant contact with Baghdadi and officials deduced that his presence in the convoy likely meant that Baghdadi was with him. However, monitoring of the group\u2019s communications in the aftermath of the attack has revealed nothing to suggest that Baghdadi was killed. Officials have not ruled out that he may have been injured. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking at it very closely,\u201d said an Iraqi intelligence official. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing yet, and as time ticks on it may be less likely.\u201d Jihadist forums have remained mute since the strike took place. The death of Baghdadi would be difficult to keep quiet even among the tight discipline of Isis, which has proven difficult for Iraqi, or international agencies, to penetrate ever since it changed the modern face of the Middle East in June when it made rapid territorial gains in Iraq and seized Mosul, the country\u2019s second largest city. Iraqis officials claimed to have killed two senior Isis members on Saturday in a raid they carried out on the town of al-Qaim near the Syrian border. The raid took place on a house where senior leaders were meeting and is thought to have killed the overall leader of Anbar province, Adnan Latif al-Suweidi, and Isis\u2019s leader in the Euphrates valley, Bashar al-Muhandi. Both held senior leadership positions in the organisation. Targeted raids, carried out by the US and its Arab allies in the region, have proven effective in slowing the momentum of the group, according to Iraqi officials and one senior Isis member.However, they have failed to curtail its strategic aims. The air strike near Mosul came hours after Barack Obama said he would double the number of US troops deployed to Iraq to reinforce the offensive against Isis. On Sunday, the US president said the troop surge will place the US on the front foot as it confronts the group. In his first public comments since his surge announcement, Obama denied it represented a failure of early reliance on air strikes and said the deployment announced on Friday night \u201csignals a new phase\u201d in his campaign against Islamic State \u2013 known as Isis or Isil. \u201cRather than just try to halt to Isil\u2019s momentum, we are now in a position to start going on some offensive,\u201d he told Face The Nation on CBS. \u201cThe airstrikes have been very effective in degrading Isil\u2019s abilities and slowing the advances they were making, now we need some ground troops, Iraqi ground troops, to start pushing them back.\u201d The White House insists the new US troops will be focused on training Iraqis to fight Isis and then co-ordinating air strikes, rather that being involved in what it calls an active combat role. \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t changed is our troops are not engaged in combat, essentially what we are doing is we are taking four training centres with coalition members that allow us to bring in Iraqi troops, some of the Sunni tribes that are still resisting Isil, giving them proper training, proper equipment, helping them with strategy, helping them with logistics,\u201d said Obama. Iraqi forces have performed abysmally since Isis stormed into Mosul on 10 June. In the chaotic two days that followed, up to six divisions fled, surrendering their US-supplied advanced weapons. Since then, Shia militias have increasingly taken prominence in most frontlines across the country. \u201cWe will provide them with close air support once they are prepared to start going on the offensive against Isil, but what we won\u2019t be doing is having our own troops do the fighting,\u201d he added. But the president also refused to rule out further increases in military engagement in Iraq and Syria, which already include daily bombing raids on Isis in both countries. \u201cAs the commander in chief, I am never going to say never,\u201d he said when asked whether more troops would be sent. \u201cBut what the commanders presented the plan to me say is that we may actually see fewer troops over time because now we are seeing coalition members starting to partner with us on the training and assist effort.\u201d Obama insists this time it will be different because attacks on Isis will only be led by Iraqis. \u201cWhat we learned from previous engagement in Iraq is that our military is always the best, we can always knock out any threat, but then when we leave that threat comes back,\u201d he said.", "label": "observing"}

Following U.S. airstrikes targeting Islamic State commanders attending a clandestine meeting over the weekend, few reports agree on the facts. Meanwhile, American commanders can\u2019t or won\u2019t say whether or not he was even there or not, let alone hurt. The drama and ensuing confusion is fitting for Baghdadi, a shadowy figure whose myth may only be enhanced by the mystery surrounding his purported demise. The saga deepened on Sunday when Iraqi Defense Minister said on Facebook that Baghdadi\u2019s deputy was killed and that the self-described caliph was injured in the attack. Then Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said to be the Islamic State\u2019s spokesman, dispatched his own update. \u201cPerhaps you suspected that the Caliphate ended with martyrdom of the Caliph,\u201d the Jerusalem Post quoted him saying. \u201cI assure the [Islamic] nation that the Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is well thank god, and I wish him a speedy recovery,\u201d the implication being that he was at least injured. If so, he would have escaped a fate that claimed other prominent Islamic leaders. The assassinations began in 2006. That year, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of an earlier iteration of the Islamic State, was killed when U.S. warplanes dropped two 500-pound bombs on a house in which he met with other insurgency figures. Four years later, an Iraqi-American operation unleashed a barrage on a building in Tikrit, Iraq, killing the group\u2019s top two leaders and ushering in the tenure of an unknown figure named Baghdadi. Not surprisingly, those killings made Baghdadi risk-averse and even more inclined than other militant leaders to a life inhabited in the shadows. But while the leader\u2019s aversion to the public eye has protected Baghdadi, it has also allowed facts to melt into Islamic State propaganda, forging an identity that has become one of the most potent recruiting devices at the Islamic State\u2019s disposal. The pitch: Baghdadi is a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, holds a doctorate in Islamic studies and envisions a Sunni-dominated caliphate that spans continents. It\u2019s a carefully crafted story that separates the Islamic State from nearly every other Islamic militant movement \u2014 evidenced when fighters of the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda offshoot battling in Syria, wanted to defect to the Islamic State. All they had to do, reported the New York Times, was make a few phone calls, pledge allegiance to Baghdadi and their new life would begin. The mystique of Baghdadi, experts suggest, would make him all the more difficult to replace and his loss all the more significant. \u201cThe wounding and potential loss of Baghdadi may be of more significance for his followers\u201d than adherents of other jihadist groups, wrote Theodore Karasik, senior adviser to the company, Risk Insurance Management: \u201cBaghdadi, as \u2018Caliph Ibrahim,\u2019 to maintain his religious foundation, needs to be of a whole body. If he loses a limb in his injuries, his credibility suffers. If he dies, the death would toss the entire concept of the legitimacy of the \u2018Caliphate\u2019 on its head.\u201d Using another name for the Islamic State, Karasik added: \u201cISIS discourse will likely need to be revised.\u201d So if Baghdadi survived the American bombardment, he may retreat further into darkness. That\u2019s where he\u2019s most comfortable operating, reported the Soufan Group: \u201cHe is intensely careful about his security \u2026 when commanders below the leadership level were called to meet him, it is said that they would be told he was present in the group but without his identity being specified.\u201d Other reports said he wears masks when meeting prisoners to obscure his identity, earning the nickname of the \u201cinvisible sheik.\u201d When Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in Mosul on July 4, 2014, it marked the first time many people had gotten a good look at him. Before that appearance, there had only been two confirmed pictures him. And such \u201cobscurity,\u201d a Soufan report said, \u201cmay have provided [him] an advantage.\u201d Indeed, tracking his movements has been difficult in the black hole of Syria, where U.S. officials fumble around without a stable of contacts and intelligence services available in Iraq, according to a Foreign Policy report. \u201cThe same thing is needed to hunt down Baghdadi,\u201d Thomas Sanderson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the magazine. \u201cWhen you kill the leader, it demonstrates that anyone is vulnerable.\u201d Making the challenge more difficult: The Islamic State has altered its tactics. U.S. airstrikes have forced it hide its fighters among local communities and cities, Foreign Policy said, and stop moving its soldiers in large convoys. \u201cThey have gone to ground inside cities and this makes decapitation strikes very difficult,\u201d David E. Johnson, a Rand military expert, said. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill them if you can\u2019t find them.\u201d And few are more difficult to find than Baghdadi.", "label": "observing"}

But one unusual consequence of the ongoing battle has nearly a dozen countries on edge. After eleven civilian airliners were hijacked during the fighting, \"5+5\" member states reportedly decided to add an element to their scheduled joint military exercise. This time, simulations will include intercepting civilian or military aircraft piloted by terrorists. The air forces of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy and Malta will participate in the upcoming exercise, in co-ordination with US naval forces stationed in the Mediterranean and Italy, Anatolia news agency reported on Monday, (August 18th). \"Libya was finally excluded because of the deteriorating security situation\", Reporters.DZ quoted the Turkish agency as saying. The objective of the exercise is to counter potential threats, such as the kind of suicide attacks seen on September 11, 2001, Sahara Media reported Monday. Libya in recent months has become a hotbed for the most dangerous terrorists in the Sahel region. These include veteran jihadists who migrated to Libya after fighting in Syria. \"These terrorist elements are present in abundance in Libya and have gotten sophisticated weapons by buying them from smugglers, professional armed militias or even ordinary citizens,\" analyst Yakoub Mustafa told Magharebia. This volatile situation requires security partnerships among multiple countries, he added. According to Moroccan reporter Youssef Lakhdar, \"Co-ordination must be at all levels and not only when an imminent danger is coming.\" If Maghreb countries had coalesced sooner, the security chaos in Libya might have been averted, he said. \"Libya is now a source of danger not only for neighbouring Maghreb countries but for all countries of the world,\" Lakhdar added. The issue of Maghreb security came up August 15th, when African leaders attended the 70th anniversary commemoration of the Allied invasion of southern France during World War II. Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was among the African leaders and WWII veterans invited to watch naval parades and air shows near Toulon. His participation comes within the framework of strengthening security, military and economic co-operation between Mauritania and France, noted journalist Mohammed Yacoub Ould Moustafa. \"Many sons of the colonies participated in World War II,\" he added. \"This is why the presence of the Mauritanian president for this celebration is in recognition of Mauritania's efforts, in addition to the security policies connecting France with the countries of the Sahel,\" he said.", "label": "for"}

Intelligence reports of the stolen jetliners were distributed within the U.S. government over the past two weeks and included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, said U.S. officials familiar with the reports. \u201cThere are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,\u201d said one official. \u201cWe found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.\u201d The official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the Libyan airliners come three weeks before the 13th anniversary of 9/11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. Four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed in the Benghazi attack, which the Obama administration initially said was the result of a spontaneous demonstration against an anti-Muslim video. A senior State Department counterterrorism official declined to comment on reports of the stolen jetliners.  A second State department official sought to downplay the reports. \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm that,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, officials said Egyptian military forces appear to be preparing to intervene in Libya to prevent the country from becoming a failed state run by terrorists, many with ties to al Qaeda. Libya remains an oil-rich state and if the country is taken over completely by Islamist extremists, U.S. counterterrorism officials believe it will become another terrorist safe haven in the region. The officials said U.S. intelligence agencies have not confirmed the aircraft theft following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport in late August, and are attempting to locate all aircraft owned by two Libyan state-owned airline companies, as security in the country continued to deteriorate amid fighting between Islamists and anti-Islamist militias. Video surfaced on Sunday showing armed fighters from the Islamist militia group Libyan Dawn partying inside a captured U.S. diplomatic compound in Tripoli. The footage showed one fighter diving into a pool from a second-story balcony at the facility. Tripoli airport and at least seven aircraft were reported damaged during fighting that began in July. Photos of the airport in the aftermath showed a number of damaged aircraft. The airport has been closed since mid-July. The state-owned Libyan Airlines fleet until this summer included 14 passenger and cargo jetliners, including seven Airbus 320s, one Airbus 330, two French ATR-42 turboprop aircraft, and four Bombardier CJR-900s. Libyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft, including three Airbus 319s, seven Airbus 320s, two Airbus 330s, and one Airbus 340. The aircraft were reportedly taken in late August following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport, located about 20 miles south of the capital, by Libyan Dawn. Al Jazeera television reported in late August that western intelligence reports had warned of terror threats to the region from 11 stolen commercial jets. In response, Tunisia stopped flights from other Libyan airports at Tripoli, Sirte, and Misrata over concerns that jets from those airports could be on suicide missions. Egypt\u2019s government also halted flights to and from Libya. Military forces in North Africa, including those from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt have been placed on heightened alert as a result of intelligence warning of the stolen aircraft. Egyptian military jets reportedly have conducted strikes inside Libya against Libyan Dawn positions recently, and U.S. officials said there are signs a larger Egyptian military incursion is being planned. Egyptian President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi was quoted as denying Egyptian air strikes into Libya have taken place but suggested that military action is being considered. Secretary of State John Kerry last week told his Egyptian counterpart that the United States would speed up the delivery of Apache attack helicopters, although it is not clear the Apaches would be used in any Libyan operations. Egypt\u2019s military-backed government appears to be seeking a more significant role in regional security after the Obama administration helped engineer the ouster of Libyan strongman Moammar Qaddafi in 2011. Since then, the Obama  administration, through its announced policy of \u201cleading from behind,\u201d has stood by while Libya gradually has spiraled into chaos. The Libyan government announced Sunday that it no longer controlled the capital of Tripoli. \u201cWe announce that the majority of the ministries, institutions, and associations in the capital Tripoli are no longer under its control,\u201d a government statement said. Libya\u2019s parliament in August declared both Ansar al Sharia and Libyan Dawn as terrorist organizations working to overthrow the government. Ansar al Sharia, which is based in Benghazi, recently publicized on social media that it has obtained large numbers of more sophisticated weapons, including SA-6 surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns, rocket-propelled grenades, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, assault rifles, and armored vehicles. The group is closely aligned with al Qaeda-linked rebels in Syria. Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, told Al Jazeera television, which first reported the airline theft Aug. 21, the alert regarding the stolen jetliners was preventive and covers the region from Cairo to Lagos Nigeria. Mekkaoui said the jets are being held by the Libyan group called Masked Men Brigade, which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department in December. The Masked Men Brigade is linked to al Qaeda and Ansar al Sharia\u2014the group behind the Benghazi terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2012. Until the Libya Dawn takeover of the airport, announced Aug. 24, two other militia groups, known as Al Qaqa and Al Sawa controlled the airport and all aircraft belonging to Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways. Mekkaoui said \u201ccredible intelligence\u201d reports given to states in the region indicated the Masked Men Brigade \u201cis plotting to use the planes in attacks on a Maghreb state\u201d on the 9/11 anniversary. Counterterrorism expert Sebastian Gorka said that if the theft is confirmed, the stolen aircraft could be used in at least two ways. \u201cThe first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,\u201d said Gorka, who holds the Maj. Gen. Charles Horner chair at Marine Corps University in Quantico, Va. \u201cThe second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,\u201d he said. Michael Rubin, a counterterrorism specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, said commercial jetliners in the hands of terrorists could be formidable weapons. \u201cWho needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes? Even empty, but loaded up with fuel they can be as devastating,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cEach plane could, if deployed by terrorists to maximum devastating effect, represent 1,000 civilian casualties.\u201d Among the potential targets are urban areas and economic targets, like Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil fields. \u201cAnyone who has ever flown over Saudi Arabia at night can see refineries like Yanbu lit up like Christmas trees against the blackness of the desert,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cOne Saudi security officer once told me that they would only have about 90 seconds to shoot down a hijacked plane from the time it left international airspace to impact in one of the region\u2019s most important refineries.\u201d Rubin said in 2003 a Boeing 727 went missing in Africa fueling concerns about a terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi. \u201cWhat is striking is that more than a decade later, the United States hasn\u2019t taken the need to safeguard what are effectively giant guided missiles seriously,\u201d he said. A former Libyan general, Khalifa Haftar, has been leading anti-Islamist forces. His group has access to Libyan air force MiG jets that have conducted strikes on Libyan Dawn positions in recent days. Haftar also has conducted military raids in Benghazi. The United Nations Security Council on Aug. 27 announced plans for new sanctions on Libyan militias and terrorists. In a resolution the U.N. warned of the \u201cgrowing presence of al Qaeda-linked terrorist groups and individuals operating in Libya.\u201d", "label": "for"}

Pictures show the aftermath of the firefight, with planes completely or partially blasted and several littered with bullet holes. Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power. The militias, many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi, became powerful players in post-war Libya, filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army. Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order, but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy. On Sunday, the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital.

Fighting between Islamist militiamen and rival forces loyal to a renegade general killed 31 fighters on both sides, a security official said overnight. The fighting erupted late on Monday, with forces and fighter jets belonging to General Khalifa Hifter pounding positions of Islamist militias called The Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council, said the official. The issue of foreign military intervention is one of the most debated in the country. Earlier this month, unknown parties carried out air strikes in Tripoli, bombing Islamist-allied militias\u2019 positions. American officials confirmed reports that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were behind the two air strikes. The hours-long clashes concentrated around the city\u2019s Benina airport and the militiamen responded with artillery, added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media. Hifter\u2019s side lost 20 fighters while the militiamen had 11 killed, and 36 fighters in all were wounded, the official said. Several of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition. Fighting in recent months has mostly engulfed the capital, Tripoli, and also Benghazi, the country\u2019s second-largest city. The militias in control of the capital, operating under an umbrella group called the Dawn of Libya, have also taken control of the US embassy compound a week after they drove out rival militias. On Tuesday, Libya\u2019s official news agency said calm had returned to Tripoli, with some banks resuming work and shops and bakeries reopening. Traffic also picked up in the capital and there were long lines outside gas stations. Some families who fled the fighting areas have returned to their homes, the agency said. POLITICAL CRISIS On Monday, Libya\u2019s newly elected parliament asked Abdullah al-Thinni \u2014 the country\u2019s prime minister who resigned last week \u2014 to form a new government. Al-Thinni had said after his resignation that his government had lost control of almost all state institutions and government offices to the armed Islamist militias. The fighting forced the newly elected parliament and al-Thinni to operate in the eastern city of Tobruk. On Tuesday, Mohammed Shouaib, the deputy head of parliament, stressed that the body did not ask for \u201cmilitary intervention\u201d but for the United Nations to help Libya build its institutions, including the police and military. He was referring to an earlier decision by the parliament to call for international help in restoring order in Libya. Shouaib was speaking in a press conference with British envoy Jonathan Powell and British ambassador Michael Aron, who were visiting Tobruk to express support to the elected parliament. Meanwhile in Tripoli, a parallel government is in the making. Supported by Islamist allies, the so-called National Salvation government led by Omar al-Hassi and his 14-ministers won a vote of confidence. Al-Hassi was appointed by the outgoing parliament \u2014 whose mandate expired after a new parliament was elected \u2014 and assigned him to form a new government to challenge the legitimate ones in Tobruk.", "label": "for"}

PROBABLY FALSE Example: [Collected via email, September 2014] Seeking truth in stir of 11 missing / stolen commercial airliners from the Libyan airport during the fall of Tripoli. Origins: In early August 2014, some North African bloggers began to spread stories that several commercial airliners were missing from the Tripoli International Airport during or shortly after the facility was taken over by Zintan militia forces earlier in the summer. Later that month translations of the blog posts began to be picked up by news outlets in Western Europe and passed on as fact rather than gossip; by early September those tales of translations of blogs had spread to the United States under the guise of real news. The use of airplanes as terrorist weapons in 2001 makes it all too easy for us to anticipate their being used that way again. And despite denials from all sides \u2014 the airlines who are not missing any planes, the Libyan transport ministry, and the anti-government forces in control of the airport \u2014 the tales have found a ready audience among a populace already on edge in anticipation of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. However, there have been no statements from the State Department, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, or any other authority warning of stolen airliners. The national threat level has not been raised. Algerian and Moroccan military and air defense, already on high alert due to the unrest just across their borders with Libya, would undoubtedly have noticed multiple flights of unidentified passenger aircraft. <!-- google_ad_client = \"pub-6608306193529351\"; google_ad_width = 468; google_ad_height = 60; google_ad_format = \"468x60_as\"; google_ad_type = \"text\"; google_ad_channel = \"0054321535\"; google_color_border = \"000000\"; //-->", "label": "observing"}

While counterterrorism officials are reportedly concerned that the missing jetliners could be used by terrorists to carry out deadly attacks, the timing of the theft is also setting off alarms. The concern is that radical Islamist groups will use the planes to mark the anniversary of the deadly 9/11 attacks, according to alleged intelligence reports disseminated within the U.S. government. Reports that Islamist militias have seized the jetliners come just weeks before the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. \u201cThere are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. \u2026 We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes,\u201d one official reportedly told the Washington Free Beacon.

Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) about the jets when Bachmann remarked: \u201cThere\u2019s really two concerns. One, the planes could be used in a similar way that they were used on 9/11 in the United States. They could be used as, essentially, flying bombs \u2014 into oil fields, buildings or strategic targets. Number two, [a] plane could be loaded with terrorists, could land as a commercial aircraft in an American city somewhere, or a European city.

The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news website, cited anonymous sources who said intelligence agencies have warned the jets could be used in attacks in North Africa and elsewhere on Sept. 11. The date also marks the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, \"We have nothing to confirm these reports about missing airliners.\" A spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, Bernadette Meehan, also said there's been no confirmation that aircraft had been stolen. Images have surfaced online showing militants posing with the jetliners taken when the militants overran Tripoli's airport last month in a fierce battle that left much of the airport and its aircraft damaged. In the past four months, a renegade general has battled Islamic militants in the eastern city of Benghazi \u2014 cradle of the 2011 uprising that toppled Moammar Gadhafi \u2014 as powerful regional militias have fought for control of the Tripoli airport. Islamist-allied militias have seized virtually all of the capital. Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui said there was \"credible intelligence\" that one Libyan militia \"is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the (region) on the 9/11 anniversary,\" The Huffington Post reported, citing Al Jazeera television. An aviation security expert said the planes, if actually seized by terrorists, would pose more of a threat to countries near Libya than the U.S. homeland. Any stolen aircraft from Libya would unlikely penetrate post-9/11 U.S. air defense and security measures, but they could pose a threat to targets that are much closer, said Jeffrey Price, author of Practical Aviation Security and professor at Metropolitan State University in Denver. Airliners are required to file flight plans before entering U.S. airspace, and air-traffic monitors would be looking for aircraft matching the description of any stolen planes, Price said. An airliner could try to fly below radar to avoid detection, but the U.S. military has developed systems to detect and stop low flying threats, he said. Price said most countries near Libya, including in Europe, do not have the same air-defense capabilities and would be more at risk. The reports of the missing planes, which first surfaced in mid-August, likely sparked an international search for the planes by intelligence agencies, Price said. \"It's hard to hide a big jet,\" he said. The latest report surfaced after an Islamist militia seized a U.S. Embassy residence in Tripoli last weekend, posting video online of men playing in a pool at the compound. In late July, U.S. diplomats evacuated the compound and the capital and traveled to neighboring Tunisia under a U.S. military escort as fighting between rival militias intensified and thousands fled. About 150,000 people have fled Libya during the fighting and another 100,000 have been internally displaced, according to a United Nations report released Thursday.

It also is just two years after the Sept. 11 terror attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, a scandal that still is reverberating through the Obama administration and threatening to become a game-changer for the 2014 elections. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in that attack. What do YOU think? Do you fear for America\u2019s safety? Sound off in today\u2019s WND poll. A State Department official declined comment, Gertz reported. The officials quoted by Gertz said U.S. intelligence agencies now are trying to locate all the airplanes belonging to two Libyan airline companies, and they have not confirmed the aircraft theft, which reportedly happened after the takeover by terrorists of Tripoli International Airport in August. \u201cThe state-owned Libyan Airlines fleet until this summer included 14 passenger and cargo jetliners, including seven Airbus 320s, one Airbus 330, two French ATR-42 turboprop aircraft, and four Bombardier CJR-900s,\u201d the report said. \u201cLibyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft, including three Airbus 319s, seven Airbus 320s, two Airbus 330s, and one Airbus 340.\u201d The report blames Libyan Dawn, one of the terror organizations operating there, for the alleged thefts in late August. Following the warnings from Western intelligence agencies, Tunisia halted flights from Tripoli, Sirte and Misrata because of the potential the jets would appear in suicide missions, the report said. And Egypt halted flights to and from Libya. Gertz said military components from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt were put on a higher level of alert. Libya has been an uncontrolled disaster area since the Obama administration engineered the removal in 2011 of strongman Muammar Gadhafi from office. His departure left terror factions struggling for control as the nation plunged into chaos. Both Libyan Dawn and another group called Ansar al-Shariah were declared by Libya\u2019s parliament to be terror groups. The report said Ansar al-Shariah reportedly has surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenades, among other weapons. Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, explained to Al Jazeera broadcasting that \u201ccredible intelligence\u201d reports say the jets are intended for use by a group called Masked Men Brigade for attacks on the 9/11 date. Gertz reported that a counterterrorism expert, Sebastian Gorka, explained the events that could develop with the stolen jets. \u201cThe first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,\u201d he said. Gertz\u2019s report noted the planes themselves become an agent of destruction. \u201cWho needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes?\u201d asked Michael Rubin, of the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cEven empty, but loaded up with fuel, they can be as devastating.\u201d", "label": "observing"}

The offer to the Palestinian President which, reports say Abbas has denied, would have seen 1,600 square kilometres of the Sinai Peninsula given to the Palestinian Authority, creating a Palestinian state five times the size of Gaza. According to IDF Radio, the offer would see Abbas relinquish demands that Israel return to the 1967 borders. In the new and enlarged Gaza, the territory would be demilitarised and Palestinian refugees, many who were unable to return to their towns after the creation of Israel, would have been able to settle there. As part of the proposal, Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank would have been autonomous and continued to be under Palestinian Authority control. Sisi allegedly said to Abbas in the meeting: \"You are now 80 years old, if you don't accept this proposal, your successor will.\" The Palestinian Authority is yet to publicly comment on the initiative but unnamed sources said that Abbas rejected the deal in a meeting with Sisi. The Israeli military radio station said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had knowledge of the offer and that the United States had given its approval to such an idea. An idea along the same lines was introduced years ago by Israeli academics but Egypt rejected the proposal. Elsewhere, the future of a unity government between Abbas' Fatah and Hamas remains uncertain after the Palestinian president voiced his displeasure at the Islamist group's \"shadow\" leadership of Gaza. \"We cannot continue working with Hamas this way. There are 27 undersecretaries of ministries who are running the Gaza Strip, and the national unity government cannot do anything on the ground. \"We won't accept the continuation of the situation with Hamas as it is now and in this shape,\" he said. \"There must be one authority and one regime.\" Gaza is still recovering from a 50-day conflict which saw more than 2,100 Palestinians killed as well as 66 Israeli soldiers and seven Israeli civilians.

The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that it\u2019s a definite go. Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers. While Prime\u2019s big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers. A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides \u2014 but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazon\u2019s broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including \u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201cTrue Blood\u201d and \u201cBoardwalk Empire.\u201d Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic. Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code. For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site. The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data. Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said.

The Wall Street Journal reported similar plans in March, pegging the service as being free. At the time, Amazon denied that it had plans to offer a free streaming-media service. The Post, however, doesn't say that the service would be free, and instead suggests that the new service would likely compete with Netflix and Hulu, while under-cutting them on price (Netflix costs and Hulu Plus cost $7.99 a month). Amazon's Sally Fouts sent the following via email: \"We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers. We\u2019re often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.\" At its core, the idea of this service makes sense. Amazon could use this new, cheaper streaming service as a way to ease people into its ecosystem so they'll be more likely to eventually make the jump to Prime, while also giving it a way to entice potential customers who don't care about Prime's free shipping but want a Netflix alternative.

In case you're having deja vu, the WSJ reported exactly the same thing back in March and Amazon firmly denied it. However, the Post confidently said that the offering is now a definite \"go.\" One of its sources for the rumor is a potential advertiser, which said Amazon would unveil the service in order to increase its video share against arch-rival Netflix -- and ultimately tempt users into Prime memberships. Amazon (sort of) offers limited ad-supported streaming now, by letting non-Prime users watch a limited selection of Prime shows with commercial breaks. If the Post's report proves accurate, the launch of a larger ad-supported streaming service may mean that the current version successfully enticed Amazon customers to buy Prime. Amazon recently scored a deal to stream classic HBO programs like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in a minor coup over Netflix. But it still has less than a tenth of its competitor's size -- and we imagine that \"free\" looks pretty good to a lot of users, ads or not. So far Amazon hasn't commented on the matter, but we've reached out for more information.

Meanwhile, Amazon is already gaining ground on streaming rivals. A recent Sandvine study found that Amazon Instant Video has established itself as the second largest paid streaming video service in North America, though Netflix still dominates. Netflix accounted for 34.9 percent of downstream North American traffic in the peak evening hours this year. Amazon had only 2.6 percent of downstream traffic, but its share has more than doubled in the past 18 months, Sandvine said. On other news, Amazon is also mulling its own travel service, which would let you book stays at independent hotels and resorts, according to a report from travel news site Skift. The so-called Amazon Travel site, set to launch around Jan. 1, would reportedly \"feature a curated selection of hotels within a few hours' drive from New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle.\" Amazon declined to comment about the travel site rumor.

Instead, Apple currently plans to introduce the service, at least in beta form, at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in early June. The WWDC keynote takes place on Monday, June 8th, so that\u2019s when the debut will likely occur. The new iTunes music streaming service is based on technology acquired from Beats Music, including curated playlists, cloud-based libraries, and offerings customized to the musical tastes of individual users. The service will be priced as high as $7.99 per month, which is less expensive than current $9.99 pricing for Beats Music, Spotify, and Rdio\u2026 The service was initially planned for launch earlier in 2015, but was delayed by the departures of key employees, as well as difficulties integrating Beats human and technology resources into Apple. Some Beats executives such as Bobby Gaza, who was a Senior Vice President at Beats in charge of technology, have departed Apple in recent weeks. The new Apple-made service will also make way for Apple\u2019s first entirely-in-house Android application, but sources say that delays to the Android app are also possible as some of Apple\u2019s Android developers have also left the company. Apple has, not coincidentally, published job listings for Android developers in recent days. Apple currently plans to launch the new music service as part of an iOS 8.4 upgrade for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch following WWDC, but a final decision has not yet been made. It\u2019s possible that the service will be bundled into iOS 9 this fall, which is expected to have a significant focus on bug fixes and stability improvements. The service will be integrated into the standard iOS Music application and will function similarly to Beats Music for iPhone, but it will have an entirely Apple-designed aesthetic that matches the Music app and iOS. On the Mac side, the new service will be implemented with an iTunes update. As for the Apple TV, the new service will be an app that replaces the existing Beats channel. Sources say that Apple is also finishing up work on a slimmer Apple TV set-top-box with a more capable and tactile remote control and a redesigned operating system bundled with an App Store. As of last fall, Apple had hoped to debut a new set top box as soon as this month, but with reports of the discussions between Apple and content providers being in only \u201cearly stages\u201d, it seems that, just like last year, content roadblocks could keep the new Apple TV from debuting until another point in the future. As we learned yesterday regarding the larger iPad Pro, Apple will have another busy fall, so perhaps the new Apple TV will launch later in the year. While the streaming service won\u2019t debut at the March event, as some had hoped, Apple still has plenty to talk about. The Apple Watch will be the cornerstone of the event, where sources expect Apple to spend a significant amount of time introducing and demonstrating third-party WatchKit applications as selling points for the device. It is also highly likely that Apple will discuss the rest of the price points for the device and its accessories before the April ship date. Apple has a redesigned MacBook Air with Retina display in the works for this year, but it remains unclear whether Apple actually plans to debut the computer at the March event.", "label": "for"}

According to The Michael Report, Apple next week will finally introduce the long-rumored 12-inch Retina MacBook Air. Many are expecting Apple [to] talk more about the Apple Watch. However, sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible. There are few things worth mentioning here. First, a Retina MacBook Air has been a long time coming. The first iteration of the Retina MacBook Pro first launched back in June of 2012. Now we\u2019re already well into 2015 and it\u2019s about time that the MacBook Air received some Retina love. Indeed, rumors of a Retina MacBook Air being in the works stretch all the way back to 2013. Second, reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (who has an incredibly accurate track record when it comes to Apple rumors) issued a research report last month indicating that Apple has plans to release a Retina MacBook Air sometime during the first quarter of 2015. Further, we reported this past September that Apple was eyeing a mid-2015 release date for a new MacBook Air model. Third, the technology to support a Retina Display on such a compact notebook is finally right around the corner. Remember that a Retina Display, with so many pixels in play, naturally drains up more battery power during day to day use, a fact which likely explains why the product was reportedly prone to developmental delays. Apple, after all, prides itself on best in class battery life and it would much rather wait than rush to release a laptop with shoddy battery life. That said, Apple\u2019s upcoming notebooks will likely feature Intel\u2019s next-gen Broadwell processors which promise to deliver a discernible increase in power efficiency. Putting all of these factors together, it certainly seems more than plausible that Apple will introduce a new member to its notebook lineup come next Monday. Lastly, there are two more details to keep an eye on: First, a tantalizing rumor from a few months ago claimed that Apple\u2019s next-gen MacBook Air will be available in new color options: Space Grey and Gold, to be exact. And second, if a 12-inch Retina MacBook Air is released, some reports have claimed that Apple, in turn, will lower the pricepoints on the 11-inch and 13-inch MacBook Air models.", "label": "observing"}

Supply chain sources who spoke to the press have also said that Apple ramped up their production in late 2014 and entered the mass production stage in December, with the goal of producing enough units for an early-2015 debut. Apple\u2019s MacBook Air line, which got upgraded in April last year (the only real upgrade being a small speed bump), still features a non-Retina screen with the same screen resolution that hasn\u2019t been updated since late 2010. This is a stark contrast from the rest of the Apple computer lineup, which have been steadily upgraded to a Retina (or at least, a version of it is offered) screen since the first Retina MacBook Pro was unveiled in 2012. The upcoming Retina MacBook Air, if earlier reports are to be believed, will come in an ultra slim design that combines the productivity of the current larger-screened 13-inch MacBook Air with the portability of the 11-inch MacBook Air. Internally, the new Retina MacBook Air is said to feature Intel\u2019s next-generation Broadwell Core M low-power processors, which would allow Apple to strip the computer of its fan assembly to create an even thinner profile. Other compromises Apple reportedly made in exchange for a thinner and lighter body includes the full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors and SD card slots.

Rendering of the 12-inch Retina MacBook Air created by Martin Hajek When taking these rumors into account, along with the fact that the MacBook Air is due for an update, the introduction of the Retina MacBook Air at Apple's March 9 event does seem like a possibility. It's also possible Apple will introduce new models of the existing 11 and 13-inch MacBook Air at the event -- the last update was in April and there was a rumor suggesting an update in February was imminent. Core M Broadwell chips believed to be appropriate for the 12-inch Retina MacBook have been available since November, and chips appropriate for the standard MacBook Air began shipping in January. Along with a Retina display, the 12-inch MacBook Air is rumored to come without a fan assembly for silent operation, made possible by the aforementioned Core M chips, and it may also include a revamped trackpad that does not incorporate a mechanical button. It is said to feature smaller bezels in a Retina MacBook Pro-style black, a keyboard that stretches right to the edges of the machine, and speakers that are located above the keyboard. The Michael Report has a mixed track record when it comes to rumors. The site accurately predicted some design elements of the iPad Air 2, but its predictions may have been based on dummy models that were circulating around the Internet at the time. The site also shared details on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus ahead of their launch, inaccurately calling the iPhone 6 Plus the \"iPhone 6L\" and suggesting the iPhones would come with quad-core processors and sapphire displays. More details about what Apple plans to unveil at its Monday, March 9 event may come out through the week.

Notably, Apple\u2019s 21.5-inch iMac hasn\u2019t been updated since late 2013, but we haven\u2019t heard any rumblings about a refresh being in the works any time soon.", "label": "for"}

Production of the 12.9-inch-screen iPad is now scheduled to start around September because of delays involving the supply of display panels, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren\u2019t public. Apple had initially planned to begin making the larger version this quarter, people familiar with those plans had said. A new big-screen tablet is part of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook\u2019s effort to reinvigorate the iPad product line, where sales have declined for four straight quarters. IPads are also facing competition from larger iPhones, which were introduced in September and helped Apple deliver record profit in the latest quarter. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, currently sells the iPad with a 9.7-inch display and the iPad mini, which has a 7.9-inch screen. Apple hasn\u2019t disclosed plans for a bigger iPad. Existing suppliers to Apple include Sharp Corp., Japan Display Inc. and LG Display Co., according to the company\u2019s supplier list. LG Display fell 2.5 percent to a four-month low in Seoul. Sharp fell as much as 2.6 percent before closing 0.9 percent higher in Tokyo while Japan Display dropped 2.1 percent. Business Tools A larger iPad could also bolster Cook\u2019s initiative to make Apple\u2019s products more appealing to business users. Apple announced a partnership last year with International Business Machines Corp. to create mobile software for businesses and for IBM to help sell iPads to corporate customers. Even as consumers shift away from tablets in favor of bigger smartphones, businesses remain a growth opportunity for iPads because the devices can be used for field work and as laptop replacements. In total, global sales of tablets to businesses, institutions and governments are projected to jump to 101 million units in 2018 from 19 million in 2013, according to IHS Technology. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn cited the opportunity to boost iPad sales to businesses as one of the key reasons why he thinks Apple shares are undervalued. Improvements to the iPad and the IBM partnership should help boost revenue from the device by 13 percent in each of the next three fiscal years, Icahn wrote in a public letter to Cook last year.

For a monthly fee, viewers will be able to get HBO content without having to pay for an entire cable package. HBO\u2019s long-standing relationship with pay-TV packages has prevented it from capturing key audiences, including younger people who may have never paid for TV service before and watch most of their entertainment online.

HBO's Chief Technology Officer Otto Berkes also resigned at that time. At $15 per month, the service will be priced similarly to what consumers pay to add HBO onto their cable packages.

With \u201cHBO Now,\u201d HBO\u2019s corporate parent, Time Warner Inc., is looking to a whole new generation of distributors for HBO such as Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PlayStation, Amazon and others to help market the service to an estimated 10 million U.S. broadband subscribers who do not pay for a cable TV bundle.

The web service will allow HBO to sign on a new group of distribution partners, which it sees as no different than when it added satellite TV and, later, telcos like Verizon and AT&T. Each of those distributors pays a wholesale price for HBO and then resells it to consumers for anywhere from $13 to $18 a month.

At $15 a month, HBO Now will be significantly more expensive than Netflix, which ranges from $8 to $12 a month for various levels of service, but cheaper than some were predicting. HBO makes the case that it has more original programming than Netflix and a better, more current film library. \u201cIt\u2019s a premium product and it will be priced accordingly,\u201d HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during a Time Warner earnings call in February. HBO\u2019s push to launch HBO Now comes after years of talking about launching an over-the-top service that bypasses traditional cable TV. It has been met with some resistance from current distributors, such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast, two companies in the midst of a $46 billion merger, according to sources. But HBO heard the same misgivings from cable when it first added satellite TV providers and then telcos as distributors. HBO\u2019s strategy is to give early partners a pricing advantage over newer ones; it\u2019s unclear how this will go over with Apple, which has a track record of squeezing advantageous deals out of media, including the 99 cent single, more than a decade ago.

So it's likely a safe bet that recent HBO content would be available through the Apple service. At a price point that's double the monthly fee for both Netflix and Hulu, the new service had better deliver on quantity, as both services offer robust streaming libraries of their own. However, while the quality of the content on those services can vary wildly, the HBO brand is known for its acclaimed original series like The Wire, The Sopranos, and Six Feet Under. Fans of HBO's programming, who increasingly occupy a demographic that's moving away from cable, have long craved a cable-free streaming service\u2014but HBO has deflected the matter for years.

BREAKING: Sources tell @JBoorstin that Apple & HBO are in talks for Apple TV to be a launch partner for 'HBO Now'. https://t.co/hQd9AzA3Xr\u2014 CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) March 4, 2015 Apple could potentially be one of HBO's launch partners for its web-only service, which may be called \"HBO Now.\" News of HBO's web-based subscription service first surfaced in October of 2014, after HBO CEO Richard Plepler shared the company's plans at an investor presentation. The service, aimed at cable cutters, will allow users to access HBO content without a cable subscription for a set monthly fee. With the launch of a cable-free subscription service, HBO will become the first major premium content provider to cease limiting its television and movie offerings to cable subscribers. According to Learmonth, HBO's web-only subscription will launch in April alongside the premiere of the fifth season of Game of Thrones, which takes place on April 12. The service is said to cost $15 per month, which is roughly how much it costs to subscribe to HBO through a cable company. A partnership with Apple would allow the service to be watched on the Apple TV, much like the existing version of HBO's service, HBO Go. HBO Go is available to all existing HBO subscribers on a variety of devices like the iPad and Apple TV, but it requires an HBO subscription through a cable or satellite provider. Cable companies like Time Warner and Comcast have long been reluctant to offer piecemeal pricing and companies like HBO have previously avoided moving away from traditional cable models in order to preserve the status quo and avoid upsetting existing revenue streams. The introduction of HBO's service will be a major victory for cord cutters, and it could encourage other content providers to introduce similar offerings. Content providers' reluctance to shift away from traditional cable pricing models has been one of the major factors that's prevented Apple from establishing deals for its own service in the past.

The news comes as HBO puts the finishing touches on its impending HBO Now standalone streaming service, built and designed by Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is scheduled to debut by April 12. Currently HBO subscribers typically pay for the channel's programming and service through a cable, telecomm or satellite provider, paying either a set standalone monthly fee or as part of a content bundle package. With HBO Now, however, consumers will be able to subscribe directly from HBO for a $15 monthly fee. Reports say Time Warner, which owns HBO, is aiming to build a network of distributors to push the HBO Now service to the 10 million broadband households that are not subscribed to a cable TV bundle service, and the 70 million cable TV subscribers who aren't HBO subscribers. Pulling Apple TV on as a partner would be a huge win-win given Apple's computing ecosystem and the access to Apple smartphone consumers. For Apple, landing HBO Now for its fledgling Apple TV would be a major coup and compliment HBO Go, a mobile streaming service, already available via Apple TV since 2013. HBO's subscriber price for HBO Now, however, may prove a sticky point as entrenched competitor Netflix has kept its prices at nearly half that cost. There's also the potential of exhausting consumers with fees given they're already laying out money for the Web TV boxes and sticks. While these costs are typically much less than a cable subscription the increasing number of standalone services could prove to be confusing and ultimately more expensive at some point. It's clear, however, that HBO believes the HBO Now cost is appropriate and isn't about the change the reported pricing of $15 a month. \"It's a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,\" HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during an earnings call last month. Obviously some Time Warner shareholders like the idea of HBO and Apple partnering as shares rallied end of day Wednesday on the reports though ultimately ended flat. At this point HBO is not providing details regarding the Apple partnership report, and Apple has declined to comment.  \"We know there's great anticipation around our standalone streaming service,\" an HBO spokesman said in a statement. \"And when we have details to share, we will do so.\" Another compelling aspect for Apple striving to be the sole HBO Now partner is the fact that HBO produces \"Games of Thrones,\" one of the most popular streaming content programs to date. The arrival of HBO Now is expected to debut with the fifth season's premiere. Yet streaming content competitors' programs have been pulling in strong viewer support as well. Netflix's \"House of Cards\" series is extremely popular and Amazon's original content program, \"Transparent,\" has won an Emmy award.", "label": "for"}

The report says that HBO is targeting a launch for Now in early April, ahead of the start date for Game of Thrones. While Game of Thrones would be a great way for HBO to drive subscriptions to the new service, it'll have to be careful if it plans to do that: last year, HBO's online streaming option for cable subscribers, HBO Go, wouldn't work for many who were trying to watch during the premiere. That would be a very bad look for a new service, and the Times says that HBO doesn't plan on launching until it's satisfied that it can do so without issue. $15/MONTH WOULD MAKE HBO'S SERVICE NEARLY TWICE THE COST OF NETFLIX Apple is reportedly one of the partners that HBO could launch its new service with. According to the Times, Apple has been aggressive in its attempts to secure a place as one of HBO's launch partners. If a deal is made, Apple TV users would be able to access and stream HBO Now, potentially through a standalone app. Apple has been adding more and more channels to the Apple TV over the last couple years, and the addition of HBO's subscription streaming service would make its device all the more appealing. The Times notes that HBO's parent company wants to see this service be accessible on platforms like the Roku, Xbox, and PlayStation as well, but it's not clear if discussions are ongoing. Nonetheless, it seems likely that HBO would want to work with multiple major partners to get this service out there. It's still not known what HBO's subscription streaming service will actually offer. Though many will hope for the same access that HBO Go receives \u2014 that is, all of HBO's original content and the movies it's currently playing \u2014 it's possible that won't be the case. HBO may want to position this service as something distinctly different from its cable service as a way to prevent subscribers from moving online. On the other hand, the $15 per month fee may mean that HBO is earning about as much regardless of how you subscribe. That price would make it tougher to compete with Netflix, but HBO hasn't exactly had trouble finding people willing to pay subscription fees that high in the past. With the even wider audience that this service will open it up to, HBO may not be that worried.", "label": "for"}

Early reports on the progress of the device\u2019s creation indicated that it would boast an array of sensors for measuring many different facets of a wearer\u2019s health, but when Apple demoed the first unit last year, those sensors were nowhere to be found. Some of those features, like the ability to track stress and blood pressure, were simply too complex to institute, or ran the risk of triggering government regulation that the company wanted to avoid. In other cases, sensor makers weren\u2019t able to meet Apple\u2019s standards (not an uncommon phenomenon). The report says that the sensors for some features performed very inconsistently, with a host of unpredictable variables\u2014ranging from tightness of the watch band to hairiness of the wearer\u2019s arm\u2014could lead to incorrect readings. With some of the most interesting features now on the chopping block, the Journal claims that Apple\u2019s executive team was left without much of a direction for the device and wondering what would draw customers to it. What the team eventually settled on was the product hitting store shelves in April. It doesn\u2019t boast as many impressive health-focused features as originally planned, and attempts to fill in the gaps by offering other attractions, such as heartbeat-based messaging and communication tools. Some of the simpler health features also made it into the finished product. The report\u2019s sources said that while these features were cut during the development of the first-gen model for a reason, there\u2019s a possibility they could appear in later versions. Another Journal report also notes that Apple is currently looking to manufacture 5-6 million units for the April launch: Apple has asked its suppliers in Asia to make a combined five to six million units of its three Apple Watch models during the first quarter ahead of the product\u2019s release in April, according to people familiar with the matter. Half of the first-quarter production order is earmarked for the entry-level Apple Watch Sport model, while the mid-tied Apple Watch is expected to account for one-third of output, one of these people said. Orders for Apple Watch Edition \u2013 the high-end model featuring 18-karat gold casing \u2013 are relatively small in the first quarter but Apple plans to start producing more than one million units per month in the second quarter, the person said. Analysts expect demand for the high-end watches to be strong in China where Apple\u2019s sales are booming. If the report is accurate, a 50%/33% split for the Apple Watch Sport and the Apple Watch would leaves 17% of the 5-6 million units\u2014850,000 to just over 1 million\u2014as gold Apple Watch Edition models.

According to The Wall Street Journal, sources claim Apple Watch was supposed to be much more than the device unveiled last year and slated to launch in April. Specifically, Apple executives wanted to produce a cutting edge health-monitoring tool, one capable of measuring a user's blood pressure, heart rate, stress level and more, said people familiar with the matter. The publication says the setbacks forced Apple executives into a corner when it came to marketing the device to the general consumer. As it stands, Apple Watch boasts a variety of sensors, including accelerometers, touch inputs and a bespoke optical heart rate sensor, the latter of which connects to the iOS Health app for fitness and wellness tracking. While polished and presented in a slick package, Apple Watch is powered by technology on a par with competing devices running flavors of Android. Aside from catchall smartwatch devices, a number of standalone solutions for off-the-shelf medical style monitoring already exist in the form of products \u2014 usually wrist-worn \u2014 from smaller manufacturers and startups. For example, the W/Me band incorporates a specialized sensor to measure a user's autonomic nervous system for keeping track of stress levels, while the latest products from Fitbit tout all-day heart rate monitoring. Apple started development of its Watch four years ago, with an eye on health and fitness, but the project was quickly dubbed a \"black hole\" for sucking in resources. Advanced technology and component reliability failed to meet Apple's rigorous standards, sources said. For example, skin conductivity sensors showed promise in early designs, but later testing showed actual results varied person to person, with everything from hairy arms to strap tightness contributing to unreliable readings. The company also investigated incorporating blood pressure and blood oxygen measurement features, but results were inconsistent. Apple is seemingly investing on health-minded devices and programs, as evidenced by recently discovered job postings, but will take a more mainstream approach for the first generation Watch. Instead of focusing exclusively on health and fitness, the device is being positioned as a niche-filling fashion accessory, iOS compatible smartwatch, iPhone companion and daily communicator, among others. Apple Watch does, however, sport a few Apple-only features, including Apple Pay integration and WatchKit development tools that are expected to foster a rich ecosystem of bite-sized apps later this year.", "label": "for"}

The Apple Watch that Apple showed off at its September event has a few fitness features. It can track the number of steps you've taken, whether you've been standing or sitting, and the number of calories you've burned. It uses a combination of an accelerometer, heart rate sensor, and your iPhone's GPS to track this data, and its functionality as a fitness gadget is mostly related to the way and catalogues and sets goals based on that data. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Apple's original plans for the watch included other sensors that provided more detailed data. A sensor that \"measured the conductivity of skin\" to \"gauge stress\" and track heart rate was axed because it didn't work consistently. Dry skin, hairy arms, and the tightness of the watch on the wrist all affected the accuracy of the sensor. A more conventional heart rate sensor was used instead. Other sensors could have measured blood pressure and the amount of oxygen in the blood, but consistency was again an issue. Additionally, had Apple used that data to provide advice or goals for users, it may have required regulatory approval from the FDA. These features may reappear in future models, but they haven't made it into the first-generation device. The Apple Watch is scheduled to ship in April.

The Apple Watch was meant to feature a system to track how stressed you are by measuring the conductivity of skin. You sweat more if you're nervous, and that makes your skin more conductive. The Watch also included an electrocardiogram feature that measures a user's heart rate (that's more in-depth than simply measuring a pulse). But Apple couldn't get the health-tracking features to work in the way it wanted. It found that people with hairy arms or dry skin had trouble using the health monitors. And the watch didn't work properly on people who wore it too loosely around their wrist. Other features that didn't make it into the final Apple Watch were blood-pressure and blood-oxygen-level tracking, according to The Journal. Those would have been tricky for Apple to include because providing medical advice or guidance from that data comes under the regulation of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in the US. We do know, however, that Apple secretly met with the FDA in 2013 to find out which features would come under the agency's regulation. Apple was forced to cut the advanced health-tracking features from the Apple Watch because it simply couldn't get them to work.

Apple's original concept for the Apple Watch was one that would track blood pressure, heart activity, stress levels and other functions, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing sources familiar with the device. But none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues, according to the Journal. Some features didn't work properly. Others proved too complex. And some would have required regulatory approval. As such, Apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena, the sources said. Due out in April, the Apple Watch will enter an already crowded playing field, competing with products from Samsung, Sony, Motorola, Microsoft, LG and others. It's been thought that Apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features. But if the Journal's sources are correct, some of those features proved more challenging than expected. For example, the Journal reported, Apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity, which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate. But the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people, such as those with hairy arms or dry skin, and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch, according to the Journal's sources. Apple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood, but again, the results were inconsistent. Further, if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice, they would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration -- something Apple was trying to avoid. The difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at Apple to dub the project a \"black hole\" as it sucked in more and more resources, one of the sources said. As a result, Apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all-purpose wearable. Yes, several key health and fitness features will be available and useful, especially as third-party developers create apps to tap into that market. But Apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch, including its variety of styles, its ability to act as an adjunct to the iPhone, its support for Apple Pay and its voice-activated controls. Will those features and the Apple name convince enough consumers to consider the Apple Watch over the competition? In December, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster projected unit sales of 8 million for 2015. Wall Street has been forecasting sales of 12 million to 15 million. Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture 5 million to 6 million watches for its first quarter of release. Whether initial sales are as healthy as expected, Apple will certainly come out with future models. Those could even include some of the health features that didn't pass muster the first time around, the Journal's sources added.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the company originally envisioned a device that can monitor heart rate, blood pressure and stress levels (based on the conductivity of the skin). Unfortunately, the sensors they tested just didn't pass muster, which isn't entirely surprising, since we've reviewed plenty of wearables with patchy heart rate monitors in the past. The company's engineers found that hairy arms, dry skin and even how tightly the watch is worn can affect the results, and they didn't find a solution in time. Apple Watch became known as a black hole within the company, the WSJ's sources said, as it continued sucking in resources for four years despite all the failures during testing. Its development slowed down once the company realized that a health-focused watch that meets its standards will be very hard to build at this time. The lineup of watches due out in April are a lot different from the original one Apple envisioned and are more of an iPhone companion with a much simpler pulse monitor and pedometer. Still, the company's expecting to sell a ton, reportedly ordering around 6 million units from its Asian suppliers just for the first quarter. Half of those are the entry-level Apple Watch Sports, while the mid-tier stainless steel model makes up a third of that number.

In a new report, The Wall Street Journal offers a look at the original Apple Watch health features that were dropped due to consistency problems. Apple began developing the watch about four years ago, with a focus on health and fitness. It\u2019s not unusual for Apple to experiment with many technologies or shift focus during product development, but the watch was especially challenging, people familiar with the matter said. Internally, the project became known as a \u201cblack hole\u201d sucking in resources, one of these people said.The Apple Watch originally featured sensors that measured the conductivity of skin, allowing the device to detect stress levels and heart-rate monitoring similar to an electrocardiogram, also known as an EKG. Apple also experimented with ways to detect blood pressure or how much oxygen is in a user's blood. However, a mix of consistency problems and potential oversight caused Apple to switch the focus of the device from health-related to a more general do-everything product. The skin conductivity features didn't perform well with people who had hairy arms or dry skin, while results varied depending on how tight an Apple Watch was worn on users' wrists. Additionally, if Apple decided to use the health data to provide \"health or behavioral advice\", the Cupertino company would have to seek approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulators. While these features were dropped for the first version of the Apple Watch, sources tell the WSJ that they could appear in future versions of the device, echoing a Reuters report from September. Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's objective with Apple Watch is to \"change the way people live their lives\" and that people would be surprised by the breadth of what the device can do, which includes activity monitoring, reminding users to stand up after a certain time period, and non-verbal communication with friends. Apple is currently asking developers to have their Apple Watch apps ready by mid-February, with some developers traveling to Apple's Cupertino headquarters for help. Cook has confirmed the Apple Watch will launch in April. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple will make five to six million units for the first quarter, with half of those units being the entry Apple Watch Sport and one-third being the mid-tier stainless-steel Apple Watch.

By November, reports were tipping a springtime ship date\u2014after the Chinese New Year, according to the leaked transcript of a voice message shared by retail chief Angela Ahrendts with retail employees. Apple review, Apple commentary, Apple news... Everything AppleNow that the holiday shopping season is over, overseas employees must prepare for the company's Chinese New year sale, which begins Feb. 19. Then, the Apple Watch. Apple Chief Designer Jony Ive spoke about the future of the Apple Watch during a recent event at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, saying that he unequivocally believes that the watch will help \"establish a new category of computing device.\" But how can advertisers take advantage of Apple's wearable? Mobile marketing firm TapSense is providing a glimpse of its Apple Watch ad-buying service during this week's CES 2015 in Las Vegas. According to Reuters, TapSense's product would allow businesses to use the watch's applications to notify customers of special deals\u2014but only in already-open apps, avoiding annoying pop-up ads.

New spaces will be added to Apple Stores specifically for this purpose, according to the report, which refers to this as a new \"shopping option.\" Salespeople are being trained to help customers pick out specific models. This falls in line with what we've already heard regarding Apple's retail strategy for the Apple Watch. Last week, 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman revealed Apple's retail plans for the watch, which included having salespeople ask customers detailed questions about how they plan to use the watch. Apple has emphasized the fact that it's selling the Apple Watch as a timepiece more than a gadget, so it's not surprising to hear that it's taking a different approach to retail. When it first presented the watch in September, it stressed that the Apple Watch is meant to tell the time before anything else. It's the first new product category Apple has unveiled since the introduction of the iPad in 2010, and the company's retail strategy will also be telling of how Angel Ahrendts, Apple's new senior vice president of retail, is handling the job. We're expecting to learn more details, such as pricing for more expensive Apple Watch models and availability, at Apple's event later today.", "label": "for"}

The report, citing sources familiar with the matter, adds that the high-end Apple Watch Edition will have scratch-resistant gold, which an in-depth analysis over the weekend revealed is because Apple mixes the metal with low-density ceramic particles. Apple is also said to have studied a platinum Apple Watch, but the model is unlikely to be announced Monday.\"The company has refined the smartwatch\u2019s luxury features, making the gold in the Edition model scratch-resistant, according to people familiar with the matter,\" reports The Wall Street Journal. \"It also has studied platinum watch casings, although the company isn\u2019t expected to announce that on Monday, they said.\"Apple CEO Tim Cook, during a visit to the Covent Garden Apple Store in London last month, told retail employees that Apple has \"never sold anything as a company that people could try on before.\" The chief executive added that \"tweaking the experience in the store\" will likely be a requirement when the wrist-worn device launches in April. It also appears likely that the Apple Watch will be exclusive to Apple Stores immediately following the product's launch, although for how long remains unknown.

Resort managers in Saalbach-Hinterglemm in the state of Salzburg say their planned opening is going head as expected thanks to the fact that they saved up tons of snow from last year which they have now put back on the slopes. Austria is one of the world's most popular skiing destinations and any delay in the usual season start at the beginning of December costs the industry millions. But while most resorts in the Austrian Alps are currently struggling with an almost total lack of snow, including Flachau in Salzburg and Rosskopf mountain in Tyrol, at a time when the snow is usually plentiful, Saalbach-Hinterglemm has no such problems. A recent Austrian climate report found the country\u2019s temperatures had risen twice as fast as the global average since 1880, with the number of sunshine hours in the Alps increasing by 20 percent. And although many resorts have shifted their focus to adaptation solutions, acknowledging that climate change will not be stopped or turned around any time soon, it is the ski resort at Saalbach-Hinterglemm that really planned ahead with the most success. For the seventh year running the Snow Mobile event will be taking place in Saalbach-Hinterglemm as planned thanks to the snow that was carefully stored since March. The resort management collected around 13,000-square-metres of snow from the mountains earlier in the year and then stored it by covering it with an artificial fleece and wood chips to keep it cool and prevent it from melting. A spokesman for the resort said: \"We made sure the covering was airtight, and it paid off. We estimate we have lost about 15 percent of the snow that we put away which is pretty good going given that it's been such a warm year.\" The snow is currently being spread and flattened to allow the event at the weekend to go ahead as planned. Around 22,000 people are expected to turn up to watch.", "label": "for"}

Whether it\u2019s gluten or plastics or peanuts, it seems young and new parents have more and more social taboos to navigate. The latest parenting taboo? Missing a birthday party \u2014 or sending an invoice to the absent child\u2019s parents, depending on how you look at it. A pair of British parents are still reeling from the discovery of an invoice for \u00a315.95 (just under $29 Canadian) in their five-year-old son Alex\u2019s backpack. Their crime? Not informing the parents of his classmate their son would not be attending a birthday party in December.  Julie Lawrence, the birthday boy\u2019s mother, has defended the \u201cfee\u201d as necessary to recoup the costs associated with a no-show. She said Alex told her son he would attend the party and took that as proper confirmation. She said the cost covers one ticket to the \u201cchild\u2019s party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch.\u201d Lawrence has also threatened to take the Nash family to small claims court if they don\u2019t pay up. Nash has said he understood the financial concerns and said it was the way Lawrence went about it that offended. They have also taken the issue up with the school, because it allowed Lawrence to place the brown envelope in Alex\u2019s backpack, which is against school policy. So where was Alex? Out with his grandparents, whom he chose over the party when his parents realized he was double booked for the day and it was the only chance he would have to see them before Christmas. Alex\u2019s mom, Tanya Nash, explained this to Lawrence in a Facebook exchange printed by the Plymouth Herald, the local paper that first broke the story. The ensuing Facebook debate between the two mothers now has parents around the world chiming in.  If Lawrence\u2019s side of the story seems reasonable \u2014 she did have to pay for Alex when he didn\u2019t show up after all \u2014 the Facebook conversation takes quite the turn. The moms\u2019 fight about whether or not they had each other\u2019s number and who was ruder in how they approached the other parent. \u201cThis is not the first time Alex has not turned up to a party that he has been invited to, either. the amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt, I hope this is agreeable,\u201d Lawrence writes. Nash responds that she can\u2019t think of another party Alex missed where there was a formal invite, and the pushes back against Lawrence\u2019s tone: \u201cExactly what lesson would I be learning? I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no. This is not agreeable.\u201d", "label": "for"}

Alex Nash, from Cornwall, was invited to the party just before Christmas. An invoice for \u00a315.95 was sent by his schoolfriend's mother Julie Lawrence, who said Alex's non-attendance left her out of pocket and his parents had her details to tell her he was not going. Alex's father Derek said he had been told he would be taken to the small claims court for refusing to pay. Alex's parents, from Torpoint, had accepted an invitation to the party at a dry ski slope in Plymouth, Devon, just before Christmas. However, they realised their son was double-booked and due to spend time with his grandparents, which he did. Analysis: Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent It is all but impossible that Ms Lawrence will be able to recover the \u00a315.95 party \"no show fee\". Any claim would be on the basis that a contract had been created, which included a term that a \"no show\" fee would be charged. However, for there to be a contract, there needs to be an intention to create legal relations. A child's party invitation would not create legal relations with either the child \"guest\" or its parents. If it is being argued that the contract is with the child, it is inconceivable that a five-year-old would be seen by a court as capable of creating legal relations and entering into a contract with a \"no show\" charge. It's amusing to imagine what a children's party invitation seeking to create a contract might say: \"I, the 'first party', hereinafter referred to as the 'birthday boy', cordially invite you the 'second party', hereinafter referred to as 'my best friend', to the party of 'the first party'. His parents said they had no contact information for Ms Lawrence at that time. They found the invoice in a brown envelope in his schoolbag last week. Mr Nash said: \"It was a proper invoice with full official details and even her bank details on it. \"I can understand that she's upset about losing money. The money isn't the issue, it's the way she went about trying to get the money from me. \"She didn't treat me like a human being, she treated me like a child and that I should do what she says.\" In a short statement, Ms Lawrence said: \"All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me.\" Mr Nash said he had been told he was being taken to the small claims court because he was refusing to pay. The party was held at the Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre. In a statement, the centre said: \"We would like all our customers to know that this invoice has nothing to do with Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre. \"No invoices are ever sent out from the centre to private individuals. This is a disagreement between the two parents involved and the fact that the centre has been named on the invoice is fraudulent. \"When booking a party there is a small deposit to pay on booking, confirmation of numbers and final balance are due 48 hours before the party. \"On the extremely rare occasion that people don't attend parents are generally offered other activities in compensation.\" The unwritten rules of children's parties?

The host of the party gave it to Alex via a teacher after he failed to show up for the get-together at a ski slope and snowboard centre in Plymouth, Cornwall. Alex's family confirmed that their son would be attending the party just before the Christmas holidays.

Mr Nash added: \"I drive all around the South West for my job and I have talked to quite a few people about this. \"They're all quite incredulous that this has happened. I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.\" His partner, who does not want to be named, has been in contact with the mum on Facebook and is hoping to resolve the situation. In a short statement, Ms Lawrence said she had no regrets about sending the invoice. She said: \"All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me.\" Manager of the Plymouth ski and snowboard centre, Louisa Duggan, said they would never send invoices to individuals and were upset at being dragged into the row. She said: \"This is nothing to do with us. It is a dispute between two parents. But I really need to clarify that we don't send invoices to private individuals - ever. \"We don't know the names of the children coming so we would never even be able to. \"We are upset that we have been dragged into this. We ask families who book with us to pay a small deposit and then 48 hours before we ask them to confirm the numbers. \"This gives them plenty of time to get responses in. We are quite flexible if any of the party does not turn up. \"We can put on other activities to compensate or often an adult will take part in place. \"We do need to know how many people are coming because we have to plan food and reserve activities and spaces.

The mother of Alex\u2019s friend was unavailable for comment when contacted by The Herald.  Full Facebook conversation between Alex's mum Tanya and the birthday boy's mum Julie. Tanya Walsh Hi Julie. This is Alex's mum. I don't know what has happened between you and my partner, Derek. I was very shocked to see the invoice in Alex's school bag. I did not realise that you had to pay for each child, as you never mentioned anything about money when we spoke. The only reason Alex did not attend the party was because his nan and grandad were going away for christmas and the only day the kids could go see them was on the same day as the party. I did not know this. On the day Alex decided that he wanted to spend time with his nan and grandad. I apologise for not letting you know, but I did not have a phone number or an e-mail for you to let you know the situation(I also didn't know your first name, or I would have looked you up). If I had known that I would have to pay if Alex did not go, then I would have paid you the money, no problem. I do not like fighting with people, and would prefer to settle this amicably. Julie Lawrence Hi Tanya, I didn't mention the money when we spoke because it was a child's party, it doesn't matter if you have to pay per person or for a group if people agree to going, I confirmed that with all parents on the Thursday before the party that they were going as I had to pay that day, and Derek told me Alex was looking forward to it and would see us there, to me that is confirmation. My phone number was on the invitation that was sent out to Alex. I don't like fighting with people either, and was not best impressed when Derek turned up on my doorstep, and said you won't get any money out of me, rather rudely, I do admit it rattled me. This is not the first time Alex has not turned up to a party that he has been invited to, either. the amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt, I hope this is agreeable ? Julie Tanya Walsh Hi Julie, who's party is Alex supposed to have gone to? I did speak to another mum about a party but she never got back to me with details, other than that I don't recall any other confirmed invites. The only reason Derek was angry was because of the fact that the envelope was put into Alex's school bag, when it has nothing to do with the school. He spoke to the headteacher about and she said that it's against school policy to do that kind of thing. Birthday invites are fine, but not personal items. Like I said before, no money was mentioned when we spoke, and I feel it would be inappropriate to pay you the money, when I don't know what it's actually paying for. Alex was very excited to go to the party. I didn't know until the day about his nan and grandad, and he decided he would rather spend the day with them. Like I said before I didn't have your number to let you know. And exactly what lesson would I be learning. I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no. This is not agreeable. Julie Lawrence You are paying for 1 x child's party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch, to with you said Alex was attending on the Thursday Tanya Walsh Just so you know, small claims court cost #60 just to start a claim. Also I'm not paying for something we didn't use. Julie Lawrence It doesn't cost that much Tanya Walsh It does. Also I don't think the school are very happy with you involving them in this either. I don't know why you are out for our blood and slandering us. I've told you the reasons why alex didn't go. I also told you why I couldn't call. You also don't seem to understand that I never ran away from you. I didnt hear you calling after me. I have to get to my daughter at carbeile. So if they let alex out last then I have to rush a bit because evie, my 2 year old, walks slow. So maybe that's why you thought I was rushing off. I had no reason to run to run away from you. So please do not state things as truth when you do not have all the facts. Maybe if you actually spoke to me rather than making your own mind up about what happened then none of this would be happening right now. If you had come up to us the first day back and explained about the money, then I could have explained about alex, then maybe we could have sorted something out. Instead you send an invoice.", "label": "for"}

Inspector Wendy Willson from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) confirmed that they had started an investigation after reports that pupils were returning from breaktime with torn clothing and injuries.

She said the activity had developed among children who had been watching real dogfights at the weekends with their parents and were mimicking the action at school.

Willson said she had witnessed the children getting down on all fours \u2013 barking, growling, biting and scratching each other. She said: \"They rip into each other.

Inspector Wendy Willson, from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA), was called to a school in Springs in June to intervene, when a school principal noticed a pattern of children as young as eight-years-old returning from recess, injured and with their clothes torn. Willson stated the children had been taught the disgusting action after adults, on weekends, would encourage them to watch dog fights and role play fights of their own with other children. The youngsters would get down on all fours and scratch, bite, bark and kick each other. The winner of the match would then get to \"mate\" with a child as a reward. It was unknown if the children actually had sexual intercourse. That was done in imitation of the winning dogs mating with the female dogs. Willson stated while watching one video, if she closed her eyes and listened to the children fighting, the growls, barks, etc. sounded exactly like dogs in a canine dog fight. As the children get older, Willson stated they become involved in the thefts of dogs, their training and in fights. One child was recorded as saying: \u201cIt makes me feel like laughing. It makes me feel powerful.\" During her investigation, Willson could find no other examples of such egregious horror except in the Gauteng Department of Education school district.

The horrific form of abuse, which shows just how damaging dog fighting can be to children, came to light early last year in Ekurhuleni, but not much has been done to help the children involved. Inspector Wendy Willson, from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA), was called to a school in Springs in June to see if they could do something about the problem there. Willson said the school principal, who will not be named to protect the identity of the children, was concerned that pupils were returning from breaktime with torn clothing and injuries. Teachers then discovered the children were fighting each other in dog fighting role-play, while other pupils were placing bets on who would win.

IOL  st DOGfighting 3 SUPPLIED Willson witnessed the children getting down on all fours \u2013 barking, growling, biting and scratching each other. \u201cThey rip into each other. The play is aggressive enough to cause each other injury,\u201d she said. In a video of one fight, which was much tamer than what was really happening because the children were asked to provide an example, the imitation of dogs is so authentic that if you close your eyes and listen, you will think you are listening to real dogs. The children who were bystanders were acting out the role of dog handlers and were betting R2 to R10 on the fights that were taking place. \u201cThe winner of the fight then gets to mate with a younger child as a reward.\u201d Willson was not sure if the mimicry moved on to actual copulation. She said this was in imitation of the best fighting dogs who get to be stud animals and mate with female dogs. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly disturbing that young children are being forced to be involved in this,\u201d Willson said. She added that the children had told her that in order to stop being a \u201cfemale dog\u201d, you have to bring in a younger child to take your place. Willson said the NSPCA had discovered, just as they had seen in other areas in which dog fighting had taken hold, that violent crime was increasing. The NSPCA removed dogs that were involved in fighting. It also discovered cases of bestiality and other instances of horrific animal cruelty, and removed the animals from the situation. Willson said the perpetrators involve children in the theft of the dogs, the training and in the actual fights. The children were rewarded either with money or dog food for their own dogs, which were used in fights. She said the older the child, the less empathetic he or she was. One child had told her: \u201cIt makes me feel like laughing. It makes me feel powerful\u201d. The inspector said they had recorded elevated levels of aggression, bullying and theft in the children. There had been attacks on teachers, causing injuries. \u201cI have never seen this before,\u201d Willson added. \u201cI searched for examples of children being used like this internationally and came up with nothing.\u201d The Gauteng Department of Education said it had been made aware of these allegations early last year. \u201cThe department had contacted the SPCA to request their intervention,\u201d said spokeswoman Phumla Sekhonyane. Willson said the NSPCA had conducted two awareness-raising workshops at the Springs school and the local police station, involving members of the community, principals, police, the Justice Department and child protection services, but while everyone had raised concern, nothing significant had been done to help the children. A director of IRS Forensic Investigations, Glenda Paul, said the matter was of grave concern. \u201cIt is bad enough that criminals are gambling on animals tearing themselves apart for their sick pleasure, but to involve children is pure evil.\u201d \u201cThey are like cogs in a machine\u201d Teddy Bear Clinic director Shaheda Omar said it was the first time she had ever heard of the dog-fighting role-play taking place. \u201cI have seen cases where children violate animals and show no remorse, but never this,\u201d Omar said.

Dirty secret breeding organised crime Dog fighting is defined as a sadistic contest in which two dogs, which have been specifically bred and trained to fight, are placed in a small arena to fight each other for the entertainment of spectators and for gambling purposes. It is violent organised crime that is often linked to other criminal activities. There are three broad categories of dog fighting: * Street-level dog fighting, which is usually linked to gang activities and during which people boast about their dog\u2019s strength and fighting ability. * Dog fighting as a hobby involves people buying dogs of average ability and entering them in local and regional matches. * Professional dog fighting is the most sophisticated of the three and is sometimes conducted at national and international levels. High-stake matches featuring experienced fighting dogs with established bloodlines take place. Many children in high-crime areas and informal settlementsare exposed to dog fighting intheir neighbourhoods, and this routine exposure to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance. It is well documented that by exposing children to such cruel brutality and repeated violence, they become desensitised and tend to perpetuate the cycle of violence, as well as promoting insensitivity towards animal suffering, an enthusiasm for violence and disrespect for the law. - Source: SPCA brochure entitled Dogfighting \u2013 SA\u2019s dirty little secret angelique.serrao@inl.co.za", "label": "for"}

The 40-year-old English actor is in talks to play the charismatic tech genius who gave the world the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone in Sony's upcoming biopic, The Times has confirmed. The Hollywood Reporter broke the news. Danny Boyle (\"Slumdog Millionaire,\" \"Trainspotting\") is directing the film, which may be called \"Jobs,\" from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who won a screenwriting Oscar for the Facebook drama \"The Social Network\" (released by Sony in 2010). Sorkin's screenplay is based on Walter Isaacson's bestselling biography \"Steve Jobs,\" acquired by Sony around the time of Jobs' death in October 2011. The film has had a few twists and turns: Leonardo DiCaprio previously circled the Jobs role but ultimately passed, and \"Gone Girl\" director David Fincher was in talks to helm the film at one point. Even with Bale, the Jobs biopic still faces questions, particularly over whether audiences will continue to be fascinated by Jobs. While no doubt a towering, relevant figure in both technology and culture, those two areas are characterized by swiftly moving currents, and it remains to be seen where mass interest lies when the film eventually comes out. Rather than take a traditional cradle-to-grave approach, Sorkin said at a 2012 Newsweek and Daily Beast event that the \"entire movie is going to be three scenes, and three scenes only, that all take place in real time.\" He added, \"Each of these three scenes is going to take place before a product launch \u2014 backstage before a product launch. The first one being the Mac; and the second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple; and the third one being the iPod.\"", "label": "observing"}

OAKLAND, CA\u2014Speaking over lunch last Friday, a Northern California man named Conal O'Rourke laid out what admittedly sounds like a crazy story: a year-long billing dispute over his home Comcast service that ultimately resulted in Comcast getting O'Rourke fired from his job at PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) in nearby San Jose earlier this year. But O\u2019Rourke arrived to last week\u2019s lunch meeting with Ars with an astonishing amount of documentation: he has pages and pages of Comcast invoices. He has a spreadsheet, photos, notes, business cards, and complaint letters. He and his lawyer, Maureen Pettibone Ryan, happily provided digital copies of these materials to Ars, which we have re-published with his permission here. As a result of his firing, O\u2019Rourke has hired a local attorney and is now threatening to file a lawsuit against Comcast if the company does not agree to his demands, which include \"a full retraction and apology, his re-employment with his former employer, and $100,312.50\" by October 14. A rogue $26.25 O\u2019Rourke first moved to California in early 2012 after 20 years of working for Andersen Consulting (later Accenture) in Connecticut, most recently as part of the corporate controllership division. During his career, O'Rourke developed skills in accounting, financial analysis and auditing\u2014skills that proved useful in his eventual dispute with Comcast. In February 2013, he moved to a new place in San Jose and signed up for TV and Internet service with Comcast, since the only other competitive service, AT&T\u2019s U-Verse, was not available in his building. \"I was roped into Comcast and with Comcast, my problems soon began,\" O'Rourke said. His first issues began when, after six weeks of service, he had yet to receive a bill. After eventually receiving his first bill in April 2013, O'Rourke noticed a number of problems. For one thing, his name was misspelled (an issue that never got corrected). More importantly, O\u2019Rourke noticed that Comcast was charging him for three \"additional HD outlets\" for an extra fee of $26.25 a month. He also was charged for cable boxes that he says he never activated (he planned on moving two additional TVs later on into his condominium), after allegedly being promised that he wouldn\u2019t be. Finally, as part of a promotional deal, O'Rourke says he was promised HBO and other premium channels for nine months, but they disappeared after just three. O\u2019Rourke said he called multiple times to try to get these issues resolved. When they weren\u2019t, he finally walked into his nearest Comcast store in San Jose. There he met with the assistant store manager, who gave him a business card and provided his personal cellphone number. \"He promises me that it will all be addressed and that we're going to look at it,\" O\u2019Rourke said. Then the real problems began. $1,820 in equipment he didn't order For the next few months, O\u2019Rourke says he was under deadlines at work and could not address issues with Comcast. Further ReadingComcast incompetence inspires more painful tales from customersThe horror: Man talks to six Comcast CSRs in 90 minutes, problem still unfixed.By October 2013, O\u2019Rourke said that his Internet speeds suddenly dropped off, becoming \"unworkable.\" \"I had contacted them regarding lack of responsiveness and performance issues; sometimes my service wouldn't be usable and I had to hotspot in with AT&T,\" he said. Again he called, and again, Comcast promised to correct his problem\u2014sometimes by sending technicians to his home\u2014but according to O'Rourke, the company never did. O\u2019Rourke spent part of November and December 2013 traveling overseas, so he was surprised when he returned home to find several boxes at his doorstep containing \"12 pieces of equipment\" and a December 2013 monthly bill for over $2,000\u2014including $1,820 in equipment that he insists he did not order. According to the December 2013 invoice, O\u2019Rourke was charged for devices including an \"AnyRoom Hub\" ($420) and a \"Pace Host\" ($110). On December 30, 2013, carrying these various boxes back, O'Rourke walked into the same San Jose Comcast store to return the gear and get his issues resolved. When he took a service ticket at 1:59pm, he discovered that he was Ticket #395 but that the store was only on Ticket #251. Rather than spend his afternoon at the store, O\u2019Rourke came up with a plan. \"They close at 7:00 pm, so I thought, I'm going to go at 6:45 pm, then somebody will have a fire underneath them to address the problems,\" he said. \"I had had it up to here.\" A Comcast employee named Matt Doblias ended up helping O\u2019Rourke, took back the equipment, and cleared the charges. But that still didn\u2019t get to the root of the errors that had now persisted for months. (Ars sent an e-mail to Doblias, which bounced.) \"I provided Matt with the detailed spreadsheet in person, and he asked if I could send it to him and he would take a look,\" O\u2019Rourke said. The next day, December 31, he did so, but Doblias \"responded that the spreadsheet never came through. I sent it again, then at the end of the day I asked for follow up and never heard back.\" O\u2019Rourke got irritated. \"On January 11, 2014, I was frustrated because I was felt that I had done everything,\" he said. \"I sent [Doblias] an e-mail that I was hopeful would ignite him to do something. What I did was [show Doblias by e-mail that] I sarcastically wrote a letter [Comcast Senior Vice President Lawrence Salva], recommending Doblias for the Employee of the Month award. I wrote it up but didn't put in the mail. I wanted to give [Doblias] an opportunity to fix the problem.\" The letter included lines like: The reason why I have chosen to nominate the San Jose center is simple. Their blatant disregard for the customer has made resolving my issues next to impossible. This behavior has proven to be quite profitable as I, like most customers, just throw their hands up in exasperation. However, now that I am no longer exasperated I intend on following up on my concerns. But O'Rourke heard nothing, and the billing errors persisted\u2014resulting in Comcast allegedly sending a collections agency after him. \"On February 5, 2014, [Comcast] said my account was two months past due and at that point pushing $300,\" he said. \"I don't order pay-per-view and I explained [to the collections agency] that that can't be right, and they were insistent, and I walked them through it.\" She said, \u2018What color is your house?!? Tell me the color of your house!\u2019 She went on a tirade and said, \u2018Just answer the question!\u2019By this point, O\u2019Rourke had yet to receive an errorless bill, he said, despite having been a customer for nearly a year. The following day, he decided to contact Lawrence Salva, Comcast\u2019s controller, who oversees the division of the company that deals with accounting. He spoke at length with Salva\u2019s executive assistant, describing his litany of problems. After the call concluded, the assistant said that she would have another Comcast employee contact O\u2019Rourke directly. \"An hour later I got a second call from an individual who doesn't identify herself [except as Evelyn] but says that she's with Comcast,\" he said. O\u2019Rourke asked her if she knew why she was calling, to which she responded that it had something to do with missed appointments. \"I laughed, because they missed so many appointments I don't even know which one she's talking about,\" he said. When he tried to explain the situation, O'Rourke said that Evelyn began to berate him. \"She said, \u2018What color is your house?!? Tell me the color of your house!\u2019\" O\u2019Rourke remembered. \"She went on a tirade and said, \u2018Just answer the question!\u2019\" (O'Rourke lives in a condo complex.) \"I told her that I was angry and said, \u2018You need to do your homework before you pick up the phone,\u2019\" he told Ars. \"I told her I was going to call back to Salva's office. That's what I did. And I expressed my concern and said, 'You have sloppy accounting, you don't take anything seriously, and I should go to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.' That's the regulator that makes sure that accounting is done properly. I think that some of my terminology would have indicated that I wasn't a layman. I worked for 20 years in corporate comptrollership. These errors become material after a while.\" Unbeknownst to O\u2019Rourke, however, his call apparently set off alarm bells within Comcast.

But that\u2019s exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm. IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGH\u2026 Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conal\u2019s last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse. A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conal\u2019s monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have. Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered. CUTTING THE CORD He attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation. But things didn\u2019t just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didn\u2019t order. \u201cThere were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with,\u201d he says. Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff he\u2019d never requested and had no use for. When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer. He says even this didn\u2019t convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasn\u2019t yet past due, Comcast sent Conal\u2019s account into collections in Feb. 2014. THE CALL IN QUESTION And so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast\u2019s customer service, which hadn\u2019t been of any help in the year he\u2019d been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company\u2019s Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues. He describes that callback as \u201cbizarre,\u201d with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn\u2019t specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house. So he tried the Controller\u2019s office again, to let them know that the rep they\u2019d sent his way had failed miserably at her job. During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast\u2019s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given. But something did happen. Just not anything good. WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORK Remember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast. At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal\u2019s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he\u2019d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work. Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller\u2019s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked. When he was fired, Conal\u2019s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees. But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether it\u2019s accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter. And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcast\u2019s books. So Conal doesn\u2019t quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage. In response to a letter from Conal\u2019s lawyer \u2014 he has not filed a lawsuit, but it\u2019s not out of the question \u2014 Comcast\u2019s Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conal\u2019s employer but says that Conal \u201cis not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn\u201d about his dispute with Comcast. THE HEART OF THE MATTER I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller\u2019s office. Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened. And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn\u2019t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he\u2019d paid for. I\u2019m also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call. How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a big shot at [fill in the blank]\u201c? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customer\u2019s employer? We reached out to Comcast to ask whether it\u2019s company policy to contact customers\u2019 employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement. \u201cOur customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us,\u201d reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds \u201cwe will review his lawyer\u2019s letter and respond as quickly as possible.\u201d", "label": "observing"}

The former Comcast customer, identified only as \"Conal,\" told his story to Consumerist, the site whose readers have named Comcast \"the worst company in America\" two years running. Conal says his trouble started with a few erratic charges: Bills sometimes didn't show up, and he was charged for equipment that was never activated, or that he didn't actually have. Customer service reps promised the problems would be resolved. Instead, things got significantly more hellish in October of last year. According to Conal, Comcast sent him nearly $2,000 of equipment he'd never ordered and didn't want, and tried to bill him for it anyway. But, as an accountant by trade, he had no problem documenting every billing error and overcharge, and he brought them in as a spreadsheet when he dropped off the unwanted DVRs, modems, and other equipment. Even then, Conal says, he wasn't able to get his money back. Instead, Comcast sent him to collections in February. And this is where Conal made the call that allegedly cost him his job. Per Consumerist: On Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast's customer service, which hadn't been of any help in the year he'd been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company's Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues. He describes that callback as \"bizarre,\" with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with \"How can I help you?\" Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn't specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house. So he tried the Controller's office again, to let them know that the rep they'd sent his way had failed miserably at her job. Considering that even Comcast acknowledges its customer service experience is so broken that it could take years to reform, you can hardly blame a customer who understands corporate structures for escalating his complaint. Comcast did blame Conal, though. Consumerist again: At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal's subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he'd only received positive feedback and reviews for his work. The creepiest part is that, although he was allegedly fired for throwing around the name of his powerful employer\u2014who, surprise, happens to do business with Comcast\u2014Conal swears he never told anyone at Comcast where he worked. He believes they just went the extra mile to look him up online and contact his company\u2014because Comcast cares. Comcast has confirmed at least one part of the story: In a letter to Conal's lawyer, who is considering filing suit against the cable provider, Comcast's lawyer said the company did contact Conal's job. Comcast's counsel says the ex-customer \"is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn\" about his customer service struggle. It seems that arguing with you on the phone for 20 minutes or trying to talk you into paying fees you know are fradulent is nowhere near the worst thing Comcast can inflict on you, the customer. They can apparently also wreck your life in ways that have nothing to do with your cable or internet services. Really looking forward to Comcast becoming basically the only cable provider in America!

Two days after the deadline passed, he stuck to his word and filed a lawsuit. Conal O'Rourke is going after Comcast and its controller, Lawrence Salva, for defamation, and arguing the company violated federal regulations with its poor service and overbilling. In his complaint, O'Rourke alleges that Salva, a former partner at PWC, called up an executive at PWC's Philadelphia office and used Comcast's leverage as a major client to have O'Rourke investigated for \"ethics violations\" and ultimately fired. O'Rourke says Comcast and Salva defamed him by telling his employer he threw PNC's name around on the phone in an attempt to get his Comcast service issues resolved\u2014he claims he never told anyone at Comcast who he worked for, and he wants Comcast to release tapes and emails from his interactions with the controller's office prove it. Oh, and about those service issues: O'Rourke's complaint also argues Comcast's mistreatment of him as a customer violated the Cable Communications Policy Act, and lists some particularly egregious examples: Comcast habitually misspelled Mr. O'Rourke's name as Mr. O'Kourke, making it difficult for him to receive his Comcast bills in a timely fashion, because the postal service would fail to deliver them. Ultimately, Mr. O'Rourke convinced the postal service to deliver mail to him that was addressed to \"Mr. O'Kourke,\" after he was unable to convince Comcast to even correct the spelling of his name. In addition to Comcast's continual failure to address Mr. O'Rourke's billing issues, in late November or early December of 2013, when Mr. O'Rourke was out of town, Comcast shipped Mr. O'Rourke twelve random pieces of Comcast equipment. Comcast then proceeded to charge Mr. O'Rourke almost $2,000 in fees for equipment that he had neither requested nor wanted. When he tried to get help with these issues, he says, Comcast sent him to collections. That's when he took his complaint directly to the controller, and allegedly lost his job as a result. He says he never received a single correct bill in the entire year he was a Comcast customer. Although O'Rourke originally said he would sue to get his job back, the complaint simply asks for legal fees and damages\u2014i.e., the lost wages from the six months he's been unemployed\u2014and an injunction stopping The Worst Company in America from overbilling customers.

According to the Consumerist, a customer identified as \"Conal\" claims he was fired from the accounting firm where he worked after a Comcast rep called his boss and told on him for trying to report his terrible customer service experience to Comcast higher-ups. The story starts as most Comcast stories start: with the cable company charging Conal for services and equipment he neither requested nor used. When Conal tried to cancel his subscription in October 2013, Comcast reportedly sent him $1,820 worth of equipment he didn't request \u2014 stuff like modems, DVRs, etc. \u2014 and charged him for it. When Conal created an itemized spreadsheet and took it to the Comcast customer-service reps to show them the overcharges, they refused to acknowledge the mistake. So Conal decided to escalate the issue to the company's controller, but when he spoke to someone in the office there, she was equally unhelpful. No one ever sorted out Conal's customer-service request. This, Conal claims, is where it gets messy. The accounting firm where he worked reportedly fired him after someone from Comcast contacted his employer to say Conal had called to express his displeasure with Comcast. The call kicked off an ethics investigation that led to Conal's firing. According to the Consumerist: Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller\u2019s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked. When he was fired, Conal\u2019s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees. Plus, though his company consulted with Comcast, Conal argues that bringing their name up wouldn't have helped his situation in the first place. Comcast: still the worst.", "label": "observing"}

The Consumerist reports that a man known as Conal complained to Comcast after he was billed for services he didn't actually have. After Conal's complaint, the company promised him extra television channels as a make-good but instead sent him a variety of equipment he didn't need. Conal complained to Comcast again after he was billed $1,820 for the surplus hardware. This is where things get interesting. Conal, who says he works for a large American accountancy firm, compiled a spreadsheet showing every erroneous charge he had received from Comcast, which he sent to the company. Comcast then apparently refused to reverse the error, so in February 2014, Conal decided to try something else. Being an accountant, Conal contacted Comcast's comptroller, the office that looks after the company accounts. He said he repeatedly called them about his bill, telling them that Comcast should be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Consumerist says that after this, Comcast got in touch with Conal's employer. At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal\u2019s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he\u2019d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work. Business Insider reached out to Comcast for comment on this story, and we will update this article when we hear back. After Conal's termination, his employer, the accounting company, said it had received an email from Comcast summarizing their conversations. It's alleged that Conal used the name of his employer during his calls with Comcast, a claim Conal denies. Instead, he says, someone working for Comcast researched him and discovered where he works. To make matters even more complicated, it's reported that the company Conal works for provides consulting services to Comcast. The \"lousy customer service from Comcast\" story is becoming something of a media meme. Previously, one customer showed in a video that Comcast put him on hold when he called to try to cancel his account, leaving him on hold for so long that the company's office closed for the day. Ryan Block's audio recording of a Comcast rep refusing to close his account is infamous. And earlier this year it was discovered that the only surefire way to get a refund from Comcast is to record your customer service call yourself.

Phone calls lead to recorded run-arounds that resolve nothing while wasting the customer\u2019s time. If a live customer service representative is actually reached, they may cheerily declare a customer\u2019s problem solved, only for said customer to later find out that their problem is still alive and well. And sometimes companies have insulated themselves so well against customer complaints that the customer is simply left to pound sand. But a company that will get you fired from your job for complaining to them? Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome, Comcast! While definitely not Comcast\u2019s first trip to the bad customer service rodeo, this latest case may trump all others, with Comcast getting a guy named Conal fired from his company following ongoing problems he was having with Comcast, reports the Consumerist. Conal, an employee with a prominent accounting firm, received wrong products, extra products he didn\u2019t request or need, wrong bills, and unwarranted bills \u2013 in other words a virtual blizzard of frustrating gaffes by Comcast that he could not get resolved through Comcast customer service. So, he went above their heads to the Comcast powers that be, including their controller. An unforeseen conflict that Conal didn\u2019t recognize, however, is that his company did business with Comcast. One of the higher ups at Comcast did see this though, and headed back over to Conal\u2019s employer apparently intent on turning Conal\u2019s complaints to Comcast against him. This obviously influential Comcast executive had discussions about Conal with one of the partners in Conal\u2019s company, and Conal got the boot shortly thereafter. Conal says he\u2019d only ever received positive reviews for his work, but the company claims he tried to use their name to get leverage in his dispute with Comcast. Conal maintains he did no such thing and can only surmise that someone from Comcast did some online sleuthing and figured out the connection with where he worked. This seemingly allowed Comcast to do some leveraging of their own to get Conal fired for daring to complain about their services. In the end, Conal\u2019s employer says they fired him based on an email from Comcast that gave an overview of Conal\u2019s alleged wrongdoings via his interactions with Comcast employees. Conal, meanwhile, says he\u2019s never been allowed to see that email to check its veracity, and Comcast won\u2019t release any documentation they have regarding his situation, either. So, now stuck in a literal corporate nightmare, beneath both his own disloyal, former company and Comcast, Conal is left with little recourse, though he has retained a lawyer that has reportedly been in touch with Comcast. The old adage about the customer always being right certainly doesn\u2019t seem to hold any water in Conal\u2019s dealings with Comcast. But Business Insider reports that, as also mentioned above, Conal isn\u2019t the first victim of Comcast\u2019s alleged less-than-stellar customer service.

Consumerist reports that the customer \u2014 known in the story only as \"Conal\" \u2014 began subscribing to Comcast in 2013 under a promotional offer, but almost immediately found himself charged for set-top boxes that had not been activated. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May of that year to sort out the billing issues, but they actually got worse from there.

Consumerist reports that Conal claims he never named the company when he was on the phone with various customer service reps \u2014 he believes Comcast must've looked up the information somehow.

After appearing on a local blog and a Wichita television website Saturday night, the rumor went viral, spreading to such national outlets as Breitbart.com. Then on Sunday afternoon, a spokeswoman for Research Medical Center issued a statement: \u201cWe have seen online reports that a patient at Research Medical Center is suspected of having Ebola. These reports are inaccurate. Research Medical Center is caring for a patient who presented to our Brookside Campus emergency department, however, the patient does not have the symptom profile of Ebola.\u201d That was followed Monday by a statement from the Kansas City Health Department: \u201cThe Health Department has ruled out the presence of Ebola in Kansas City.\u201d \u201cThere was a social media frenzy about the possibility of Ebola in Kansas City,\u201d said Jeff Hershberger, a department spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019re still exploring how this happened.\u201d Hospitals and the general public have been on edge since an Ebola case was diagnosed last week at a hospital in Dallas. Thomas Eric Duncan is in critical condition at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The hospital\u2019s failure to recognize that Duncan may have had Ebola during an earlier visit to its emergency room has heightened vigilance further. Details about what happened Saturday in Kansas City are still unclear, but a feverish man was taken to Research Medical Center\u2019s Brookside Campus on Saturday night. The man apparently was from Nigeria, a country that has had Ebola cases but is not among the three African countries engulfed in the current epidemic. The patient\u2019s travel history and fever \u201ctriggered them to look at things that included Ebola,\u201d Hershberger said. Kansas City police said they received a call Saturday night from a nurse who told them the hospital was under lockdown because of suspicions about the patient. The police decided to block access to the patient\u2019s apartment in the 3600 block of East Meyer Boulevard and to keep the vehicle used to take him to the hospital under observation. \u201cNeighbors saw (the police activity) and got worried and contacted the media,\u201d Hershberger said. Meantime, the blog TonysKansasCity.com posted the line: \u201cFirst suspected report of Ebola in Kansas City!!\u201d Tony Botello, who writes the blog, later revised that report. KCTV-5 broadcast a story Saturday night about the apartment building being locked down because of a potentially contagious disease but never mentioned Ebola, said Darrin McDonald, the station\u2019s vice president and general manager. If a Wichita station reported it was a case of the Ebola virus, \u201cthey connected dots that we never did,\u201d McDonald said. Gordon Beedle, a news producer at KWCH-12 in Wichita, said the station received information from KCTV about the story and posted its own version online. Beedle said he couldn\u2019t recall exactly what that story said and couldn\u2019t trace it Monday night. Sunday night, KCTV reported that Kansas City health officials said it was not Ebola. But on Saturday night, others told a different story, said Christine Hamele, a spokeswoman for HCA Midwest Health, which operates Research Medical Center. \u201cI was made aware of erroneous reports of a suspected Ebola case in the Kansas City area,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was clear to me by 11 p.m. (Saturday) was that none of the information \u2026 was accurate.\u201d Hamele said the patient was transferred from Research\u2019s Brookside Campus to the main hospital, where he was placed in isolation. He responded well to treatment and was released Monday, she said. \u201cA lot of us are on an extra alert because of what happened in Dallas,\u201d Hershberger said. \u201cWhat happened this weekend was a situation we would prefer to what happened in Dallas. We prefer extra vigilance to not enough vigilance.\u201d To reach Alan Bavley, call 816-234-4858 or send email to abavley@kcstar.com.

But the rumor is not true, according to the university. A junior student at Elon University recently wrote an article for the College Fix, a website for students, claiming the school dropped the term and replaced it with \u201cfirst year.\u201d The post claims it was an official move made by the school this fall to promote inclusivity, diversity, and ensure the campus does not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students. The National Review Online also picked up the story. The article claimed the school implemented the term \u201cfirst-year\u201d in everything from its website to orientation workshops. But Dan Anderson, vice president of university communications at Elon, told the Burlington Times-News there is no ban or new policy. Anderson said the university uses the term \u201cfirst-year\u201d because it applies to more students than the term \u201cfreshman.\u201d He said the school uses \u201cfirst-year\u201d to describe any student in the first year at Elon, as opposed to a recent high school graduate. \u201cElon has done what most schools have done and gone to using \u2018first-year\u2019 more frequently because \u2018first-year\u2019 encompasses more than just traditional freshmen,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe still use \u2018freshman\u2019 when it refers to traditional students who come right out of high school.\u201d The student who wrote the original story said she became curious when she was writing a story for the school newspaper and her editor changed the word \u201cfreshman\u201d to first-year.\u201d She said she was surprised her story got as much attention as it did and hopes it didn\u2019t put the school in a bad light.

The university has received national media attention since a student from Elon reported that the school is dropping the word freshman and replacing it with first year. The story, originally published on The College Fix, found its way to FOX News and The National Review Online, where the word \u201cdrop\u201d changed to \u201cban.\u201d The university uses first-year in its admissions process because the types of students coming into college are not all traditional students who have graduated from high school. \u201cAt almost every college, admissions is moving to this term because it encompasses traditional students and also includes transfers, spring admits, gap semester students, part-time students and non-traditional age students,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt describes people spending their first year at Elon.\u201d Anderson explained that the term isn\u2019t Elon\u2019s alone. Duke University, the University of North Carolina system and High Point all use first-year on their admissions websites. They all refer to \u201cThe First Year Experience.\u201d The U.S. News and World Report publishes rankings for the schools with the best first-year experience programming. While there is no official policy on the word, first-year Blair Foreman said her orientation leader always called the group just that, and most of her professors use the term as well. She understands why the university would use it in place of freshman, but is not offended by the word. \u201cI get the intentions behind it,\u201d Foreman said. \u201cEveryone is on the same totem pole, but I don\u2019t mind either way.\u201d Sophomore Tyson Glover spent his first semester at Elon in the GAP program and said he enjoyed being called  first-year rather than freshman. He said it made his transition into college easier. \u201cComing into Elon January was different,\u201d Glover said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot going on. First year is an all-encompassing term, and made our transition smoother. It helped us get in the same boat as the rest of our class.\u201d According to the original article, Leigh-Anne Royster, director of the Inclusive Community Well-Being, said the term \u201cfreshman\u201d may contribute to sexual violence. Anderson said Royster was answering generally why people might not like to use the term \u201cfreshman,\u201d not referring to why Elon University does not use the term. Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, corroborated Royster\u2019s comments in the article. \u201cThe student asked what the primary reason was for changing freshman to first year, presuming there was a change,\u201d Anderson said. Zaiser explained that in general, some consider it a sexist term and that it is not a completely accurate description of the incoming classes. There are some students who prefer freshman to first year, though. Firs- years Mackenzie Franklin and Daniel Maclaury prefer the word freshman, saying it is a more traditional term and more natural for them. \u201cFirst year makes it seem like I won\u2019t graduate in four years,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cBut I do use them interchangeably.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: Diana Stancy, who wrote the original article for College Fix, is a senior reporter for The Pendulum.

Google Inc. has cemented a pair of massive real estate deals in Sunnyvale and Redwood City that boost the company's Silicon Valley footprint by 2.8 million square feet \u2013 about the size of the Empire State Building and enough room for more than 10,000 workers. Even by Google standards, the latest transactions are blockbusters: In one deal, Google has agreed to lease all of Jay Paul Co.'s Moffett Place, a 1.9 million square foot office campus currently under construction in Sunnyvale. It's a contender for the largest office lease ever signed in Silicon Valley and perhaps the state of California. In a separate but no less notable deal, Mountain View-based Google completed the purchase of six buildings from Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital totaling about 934,000 square feet at Redwood City's Pacific Shores office park. It's Google's first entry into that city and a potential game changer for that commercial real estate market. \"Google is obviously a very strong company and they are in hyper growth mode,\" said Amber Schiada, director of research for real estate services firm JLL. The deals \u2014 both of which I previously reported were in the works \u2014 were confirmed by sources close to the transactions. Google declined to comment for this story. Blackstone didn't return inquiries. Jay Paul's longtime broker Phil Mahoney of Newmark Cornish & Carey, would only say that Moffett Place is off the market. Google's expansion on the Peninsula has been the biggest real estate story since the 2008 Great Recession as the world's biggest Web-search advertising company has bought and leased building after building, radiating out from its Mountain View headquarters. Its real estate growth dwarfs even that of Cisco Systems Inc.'s expansion during the 1990s. Terms of the latest deals were not disclosed, but sources estimated the Redwood City sale at around $625 per square foot, or $583.75 million. That would make it perhaps Google's single largest real estate acquisition by footprint and dollar amount ever in Silicon Valley. \"I welcome them to our city and I look forward to working with them,\" said Redwood City Mayor Jeffrey Gee in an interview this afternoon. \"For a long time I would go around and say, 'Redwood City is one of the best kept secrets in the Bay Area. With Google and everything going on, we're not a secret anymore.'\" Aside from sheer size, the deals are notable for several reasons. First, they showcase Google's incredibly ambitious growth plans as the company enters new business sectors such as wearable computing, self-driving cars and robotics \u2014 all of which could be huge space users on their own. Google has not even moved into much of the space it has leased or bought over the last several years. Yet the company continues to bank more elbow room for future expansion, suggesting it is thinking far down the line in terms of its space needs. Google counted 55,030 employees globally as of Sept. 30, according to its most recent quarterly report, up 18 percent \u2014 or 8,600 Googlers \u2014 from a year ago. The transactions also alter the marketplace dynamics in two cities by taking available space off the table. Schiada noted that Moffett Place was the largest speculatively built project under construction in Silicon Valley. In Redwood City's Pacific Shores, which is more than 90 percent leased, I'm told Google will honor all current tenants' leases for now, but will evaluate moving into spaces as they become available in the years ahead. \"A big question is what does this leave for tenants,\" Schiada said, speaking specifically about the Moffett Place deal. \"It also increases rates, because the supply becomes more limited.\" Still, that could actually be a good thing for tenants down the line by pushing developers to build more product, she added. \"This deal essentially eliminates a significant portion of new development, which could prompt more developers to move forward,\" she said. Jim Beeger, a veteran broker with Colliers International, said in the short term, the Sunnyvale deal could also push tenants back into the market. The transaction could \"cause tenants of all sizes to realize they should have more of a sense of urgency in their search for a new site,\" he said. \"Moffett Place will be difficult to replicate, and those who lingered no longer have this option.\" Sethena Leiker, senior analyst for Cushman & Wakefield's Silicon Valley office, agreed. \"There's not a lot of spec development coming,\" she said. \"If you want to take any new space, you're going to have to take something that's proposed.\" One result, Beeger said, could be a \"trickle-down effect\" of growing tenants moving to other areas of Santa Clara County that have available sites. Score for Sunnyvale Google's lease at Moffett Place is a huge win for San Francisco-based Jay Paul Co., if one that's not entirely unexpected. Jay Paul already leased 949,000 square feet to Google in Sunnyvale at a nearby campus called Technology Corners, making Google a natural prospect for the new development. And while Google has not yet started moving into Technology Corners, the company has also been growing elsewhere in Sunnyvale this year, snapping up the old Juniper Networks headquarters (424,000 square feet) and former head office of Palm Computing Inc. (285,000 square feet). And it's rumored that a fund, CBRE Global Investors, that's buying up land all around Sunnyvale's Moffett Park business district is actually acting on behalf of Google. Yet landing Google wasn't guaranteed when Jay Paul started building Moffett Place earlier this year on spec. Other major tech tenants were also making offers on the property, according to sources. The rent Google is paying isn't known, but Jay Paul was asking $3.75 per square foot on a triple-net basis, or not including utilities, taxes and fees. Redwood City action In Redwood City, Google picks a up a major chunk one of Silicon Valley's marquee office campuses. The 10-building, 1.7-million-square-foot project was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and gained notice for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools, a rock-climbing wall, day spa and baseball diamonds. Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $833 million, and immediately sold two buildings to Shorenstein, the San Francisco-based landlord. Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago. Informatica also acquired two buildings out of the 10 in 2012 for $525 per square foot. Google's acquisition this week is only for the six Blackstone/Starwood buildings. As I reported earlier this month, a new owner could build even more office space at Pacific Shores. New zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet. Google \u2014 which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom \u2014 may have been attracted to the project partly for its water transit possibilities beyond freeways. Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City, where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port. Mayor Gee said the city would be happy to work with Google on such a plan, should the search company decide to go in that direction. \"One of the things that's always a challenge with new forms of transportation is, is there enough there there,\" he said. \"With Google, that potentially brings the there there.\" Check back later for more on this story.", "label": "for"}

Even by the standards of Google\u2019s relentless real-estate acquisition spree, this is a big one. The world's biggest search-engine company is buying six office buildings totaling nearly a million square feet, according to several industry sources who were not willing to talk about the deal publicly. The project is owned by the Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital and managed by Equity Office. The purchase \u2014 which could close later this month \u2014 would be Mountain View-based Google\u2019s most dramatic real estate move this year. It opens up another front in the search giant\u2019s rapid Peninsula expansion after big deals in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. And it provides a potential seaborne solution to increasingly gridlocked highways: Pacific Shores is spitting distance from the Port of Redwood City, where Google has been experimenting with commuter ferries as a way to reduce the demands on its extensive bus network. Google declined to comment. Blackstone didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. I\u2019m told the sale is close to being finalized, though it\u2019s still possible the deal could still fall through. Google's deposit isn't yet non-refundable, a customary marker for a deal headed toward the finish line, a person familiar with the transaction said. \u201cIf any deal is done by anyone, we\u2019d welcome them to Redwood City,\u201d Mayor Jeffrey Gee told me in a phone call on Friday, adding that he\u2019d wait to comment on Google\u2019s potential arrival until a deal is complete. Brokers said the impact of the acquisition, if completed, would ripple through the commercial real estate market. Assuming Google intends to occupy the space, tenants currently in the buildings \u2014 which are more than 90 percent leased \u2014 would have to find new space as their leases end. And Google tends to grow wherever it puts down roots. \u201cIt adds fuel to the fire for more spec buildings to start coming out of the ground, because there\u2019s going to be that much more pressure on space demand,\u201d said Tim Grant, a veteran Bay Area office broker with Avison Young in Foster City. The deal would mark another sign of tech companies taking a shine to the north Peninsula, coming just weeks after Box Inc. agreed to lease a major office project in downtown Redwood City. \u201cThis is one more thing,\u201d Grant said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been thought of as, \u2018Maybe, but I\u2019d rather be in San Francisco or (southern) Silicon Valley.\u2019 Suddenly, the middle maybe isn\u2019t a bad place to be.\u201d Google is expected to buy Blackstone and Starwood\u2019s buildings at 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800 and 1900 Seaport Blvd., which total 934,000 square feet and are home to tenants such as Zazzle Inc. and Rocket Fuel. Google is not buying 2000 and 2100 Seaport Blvd., the owner-occupied headquarters of Informatica Corp. Nor is Google buying 1400 and 1500 Seaport Blvd., which includes DreamWorks. Those buildings are owned by Shorenstein, which has been in contract for a while to sell them to San Francisco-based investor DivcoWest, according to sources and public records. The price Google will pay was not immediately clear, but an observer estimated it at \u201csubstantially more\u201d than the $525 per square foot that Informatica paid for the two buildings it bought in 2012. One of the Valley\u2019s marquee campuses, Pacific Shores was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and broke new ground for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools, a rock-climbing wall, day spa and baseball diamonds. It was one of the first major developments that showed multiple tech companies would share the same campus, and rose taller than the one- and two-story buildings that were the standard for tech. Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $833 million, and immediately sold Shorenstein its two buildings. Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago. A new owner could build even more office space there, city officials said. The entire campus contains about 1.7 million square feet of office space, and new zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet. \u201cAll things considered, there's still quite a bit of room to put more structures out there,\u201d said Sailesh Mehra, associate city planner for the city. \u201cYou could essentially double that entire office park, if you can you could park it.\u201d Google \u2014 which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom \u2014 may be eyeing transit options beyond freeways. Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City, where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port. The Water Emergency Transportation Authority, which administers the San Francisco Bay Ferry routes, has studied regular public ferry service to Redwood City, with a potential public terminal practically next door to Pacific Shores. \"I know they really liked the ferry and the concept. Their challenge was getting people off a boat and putting them on a bus to Mountain View, and that was taking 25 minutes,\" said Kevin Connolly, director of planning and development for WETA. \"This might be one way to address it.\" San Mateo County has about $22 million left in a sales-tax funded pot for ferry services in the county. A Redwood City terminal would cost about $15 million. But the county doesn't have ongoing operational funding, Connolly said. A major built-in user such as Google could help make service pencil out, he said. \"If they're serious about doing it, we could do something, and there are lots of options,\" Connolly said. \"We could be very creative about working this out.\" If the deal is completed, it would probably take several years for Google to truly put its stamp on Redwood City. Tenants are in the buildings long term, and Google\u2019s continued expansion elsewhere in Silicon Valley \u2014 it just leased another 424,000 square feet in Sunnyvale\u2014 means it\u2019s probably not under immediate pressure to occupy the campus. The current and future Google growth \"(is) going to impact the face of the Valley,\" Mark Bodie, a senior vice president with JLL who represents landlords, said on a market update call with media earlier this week,. \"It's really going to change the dynamics of what's available for lease.\" Updated to clarify ownership of the campus.", "label": "for"}

Paris Terror Suspect on US Watch List Met With French President Sarkozy in 2009 21st Century Wire says\u2026 As the dust settles from this week\u2019s terror extravaganza in France, more loose ends are turning up (or being tied up), with this latest bizarre bombshell which is already fueling speculation as to the covert nature of the Charlie Hebdo false flag affair. A police commissioner from Limoges, France, Helric Fredou, aged 45 (photo, below), turned up dead from a gun shot to the head on Thursday amid the Charlie Hebdo affair. A high-ranking official within the French law enforcement command-and-control structure, Fredou was also a former deputy director of the regional police service.  At the time of his death, police claim to have not known the reason for his alleged suicide. This was reflected in their official statements to the media: \u201cIt is unknown at this time the reasons for his actions\u201d. However, a back story appears to have been inserted simultaneously, most likely from the very same police media liaisons, who then told the press that Fredou was \u2018depressed and overworked\u2019. For any law enforcement officer in France, it would seem rather odd that anyone would want to miss the biggest single terror event in the century, or history in the making, as it were. Here is a link to the original report in the French media, which confirms that Commissioner Fredou was indeed working on the Charlie Hebdo case: \u201cThe Fredou Commissioner, like all agents SRPJ, worked yesterday on the case of the massacre at the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo. In particular, he was investigating the family of one of the victims. He killed himself before completing its report. A psychological \u2018cell\u2019 was set up in the police station.\u201d Helric-Fredou-3 EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: It is not yet known to 21WIRE exactly how the fatal gun shot occurred, but if any other past political and high-profile \u2018suicided\u2019 cases are anything to go by, authorities will claim that this victim either shot himself in the back of the head,  with his non-shooting hand. In addition, if that were the case, there would also be a lack of gun powder burns on the hands according to the autopsy.  UK-based investigative reporter Morris108, interviews \u2018Phil in France\u2019 regarding this new development:   Even more bizarrely, an almost identical event took place just over one year earlier, November 2013 in Limoges, when the number 3 ranked SRPJ officer had killed himself in similar circumstances, with his weapon in the police hotel. Allegedly, his colleague discovered his body. The prosecution ruled that case was a suicide too, and the police officer had left a suicide note to his family in which he expressed \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d for his surprising action.

Sputnik News Police commissioner, who had been investigating the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine committed suicide with his service gun on Thursday night. Police commissioner Helric Fredou, who had been investigating the attack on the French weekly satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, committed suicide in his office. The incident occurred in Limoges, the administrative capital of the Limousin region in west-central France, on Thursday night, local media France 3 reports. Helric Fredou, 45, suffered from \u2018depression\u2019 and experienced \u2018burn out\u2019 [according to the official statement]. Shortly before committing suicide, he met with the family of a victim of the Charlie Hebdo attack and killed himself preparing the report. Fredou began his career in 1997 as a police officer at the regional office of the judicial police of Versailles. Later he returned to Limoges, his hometown. Since 2012 he had been the deputy director of the regional police service. \u201cWe are all shocked. Nobody was ready for such developments\u201d, a representative of the local police union told reporters. On January 7, 2015, two gunmen burst into the editorial office of Charlie Hebdo magazine, known for issuing cartoons, ridiculing Islam.

The defense ministry said on its website that an operation by Yemen's armed forces early on Saturday freed photojournalist Luke Somers and led to the killing of 10 members of the militant group holding him, according to Reuters news agency.  It said the operation took place in the Wadi Abdan Al Daqqar region of Shabwa Province in the southern part of the country.  But his sister Lucy Somers told The Associated Press that she learned of her 33-year-old brother\u2019s death from FBI agents. There was no immediate comment from Washington, nor from security officials in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. Meanwhile another account suggests Somers was wounded during the operation.  \"American soldiers carried away the hostage. He was wounded and we don't know if he is dead or alive,\" the Yemeni official told Agence France-Presse on condition of anonymity. Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, where he had been working as a freelance photographer for the Yemen Times. Al-Qaeda posted a video Thursday that showed Somers, 33, and a local al-Qaeda commander threatening that Somers would meet his fate in three days if the United States doesn\u2019t meet the group\u2019s demands, which weren\u2019t specified. In a video posted Saturday near London, Lucy Somers describes her older brother as a romantic who \u201calways believes the best in people.\u201d She ends with the plea: \u201cPlease let him live.\u201d In a statement, Somers\u2019 father, Michael, calls his son \u201ca good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people\u201d and asks for his safe release. \u201cWhen foreign nationals were advised to leave Yemen, Luke refused to go, saying he felt safe and at home there,\u201d Lucy Somers said in her video. \u201cHe felt the Yemeni people would look after him.\u201d \u201cPhotojournalism has been his way of highlighting the struggles of the Yemeni people,\u201d she said. Michael Somers said his son \u201cwas confident that no one would harm him for his simplicity and honest friendship to all Yemenis around him.\u201d Luke Somers \u201ctold all his friends and loved ones stories of Yemenis\u2019 generosity, humility and devoted friendship,\u201d his father said, adding, \u201cLuke\u2019s life in Yemen these past three and a half years should not have ended with a kidnapping but with a great reward. The fact that he chose to live in Yemen and not the United States shows where his sympathies lay. Please bring Luke back to us safe and sound.\u201d Somers\u2019 brother, Jordan, and mother, Paula, offered a similar message in an earlier video. \u201cMy life is in danger,\u201d Luke Somers said in the al-Qaiea footage, which appeared to mimic hostage videos released by al-Qaida\u2019s rival, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group.

It came after the release of the AQAP video which begins with a reading in Arabic from Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, an AQAP official, before Mr Somers appears and gives a statement in English. He said: 'My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life. 'It's now been well over a year since I've been kidnapped in Sana'a. Basically, I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger. 'So as I sit here now, I ask if anything can be done, please let it be done. Thank you very much.' Al Ansi gave the US government three days to meet the demands or 'otherwise, the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate'. The three-minute video also features Ansi speaking about American activity in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq as well as recent air strikes in Syria. It follows similar videos by another extremist militant group, Islamic State (IS), which has already killed two British hostages and three American hostages in videos released on social media. Militants released a video on Thursday that showed Mr Somers, threatening to kill him in three days if the United States did not meet the group's demands Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, senior official in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, pictured, spoke for two minutes and thirty seconds during the video where he threatened to kill Mr Somers within three days IS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning. Footage claiming to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq. The news of the failed rescue comes after a suspected U.S. drone strike in Yemen killed nine alleged al-Qaida militants early Saturday, a security official said. The drone struck at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, hitting a suspected militant hideout, the official said. The official did not elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorised to brief journalists. At least six suspected militants were killed in an airstrike in the same province last month. Later Saturday, tribal leaders said they saw helicopters flying over an area called Wadi Abdan in Shabwa province. American authorities rarely discuss their drone strike campaign in Yemen. The strikes are incredibly unpopular in Yemen due to civilian casualties, legitimising for many the attacks on American interests. American commandos tried to rescue Mr Somers in a raid on an AQAP camp late last month, but he had been moved by the time they arrived Begging for mercy: Luke's brother, Jordan (left), and his mother, Paula Somers (right), released a video on Thursday asking his al-Qaeda captors to release him In a statement on Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby acknowledged for the first time that a mysterious U.S. raid last month had sought to rescue Mr Somers but that he turned out not to be at the site. Kirby did not elaborate on the joint U.S-Yemeni operation to free Mr Somers, saying details remained classified. However, officials have said the raid targeted a remote al-Qaida safe haven in a desert region near the Saudi border. Eight captives - including Yemenis, a Saudi and an Ethiopian - were freed. Mr Somers, a Briton and four others had been moved days earlier. Mr Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 as he left a supermarket in the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, said Fakhri al-Arashi, chief editor of the National Yemen, where Mr Somers worked as a copy editor and a freelance photographer during the 2011 uprising in Yemen.

A drone struck a suspected AQAP hideout at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, it said, and a subsequent raid freed an unnamed US hostage and killed 10 extremists. It was unclear whether the hostage described was Mr Somers. No further details have emerged of Saturday's operation but the Pentagon admitted on Thursday that a secret raid last month had got the wrong location. Special forces arrived at the target location, in a remote al-Qaeda safe haven in the desert near Yemen\u2019s border with Saudi Arabia, to find Mr Somers was not there. The American government considers AQAP to be the world's most dangerous arm of the international terrorist organisation after linking it to several failed attacks on US soil. Mr Somers was born in Britain and holds dual US-UK citizenship. Having spent most of his life in the United States, he worked for two years in Yemen as a freelance photojournalist, sub-editor and interpreter for English language newspapers. American authorities rarely discuss their controversial drone strike campaign in Yemen, which are known to cause civilian casualties, legitimising violent resistance against US intervention in the country. Al-Qaeda and Islamist militants have gained a foothold in large parts of southern and eastern Yemen, where the government is struggling to exert control outside main cities. The Pentagon has not replied to The Independent's request for confirmation. Additional reporting by agencies", "label": "for"}

The official said that the journalist, Luke Somers, 33, was apparently shot by his captors as the raid unfolded and was badly wounded when the commandos reached him. By the time Mr. Somers was flown to a United States naval ship in the region, he had died from his injuries, the official said Saturday.

On Wednesday, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemeni extremist group that was holding Mr. Somers, threatened to kill him by the end of the week if its demands were not met. In the video, a leader of the group spoke of the November raid and warned the United States not to carry out any similar operations.

The young man seemed happy and healthy when this photo was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before his death. Forensic scientists and experts from the hospital Carlos III had to perform a wide battery of tests and analysis before we can accurately determine what caused the death of Mr. Ramos, and this because of an allergic reaction to seafood, because the only things he had swallowed before his death were bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich accompanied by a cocacola light. They were surprised when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested allergens contained not only related to fish, but also some antibiotic resistance genes that had prevented the white blood cells of M. Ramos to save his life. \"At first we thought there had been some form of contamination of food, contact with fish or seafood during the preparation\" , explained Dr. Rafael P\u00e9rez-Santamarina. \"It ' is that when we tested the tomato itself, we noticed that it contained certain allergens commonly found in seafood. We did a lot of different analyzes and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. \" Several experiments on GMOs produced horrible tumors and even killed rats in laboratories, but most of GM products on the market were considered harmless to humans. Several experiments on GMOs produced horrible tumors and even killed rats in laboratories, but most of GM products on the market were considered harmless to humans.   Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed linked to the ingestion of genetically modified foods. It contradicts most studies on GMOs that have concluded that genetically modified current market crops were edible and without dangers. A team of scientists led by the University of Nebraska had anticipated this problem in 1996, when they found that the protein of a walnut in Brazil, introduced to improve the nutritional quality of GM soy was able to cause an allergic reaction in Brazil. However, this problem has been rejected by most scientists as unlikely as it could easily be avoided with appropriate safety tests. Soybean genes injections in Brazil nuts were effectively abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused the death of Mr. Ramos was not enough to be tested and risk of death had not been identified before marketing. The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality, which placed the order of Portuguese origin tomatoes that have infected the young man, demanded that they be repatriated and removed from shops and markets for reasons security. More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will be seized across the country by ministry inspectors and officials of public safety. The ministry also made \u200b\u200ba public announcement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which he offers his condolences to his family and added that \"immediately request further research on the subject, to determine if other food products GM on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population. \"", "label": "for"}

A report by a respected Silicon Valley journalist for Forbes said around 26% of the company's 430,000-strong workforce would be cut this week. The previous largest corporate redundancy was also carried out by IBM, when it cut 60,000 staff in 1993. The company's reorganisation is codenamed Project Chrome, and most of the staff being laid off are in the US.

In a statement to Sky News, an IBM spokeswoman said the rumour was \"ridiculous\" and \"baseless\". She said: \"If anyone had checked information readily available from our public earnings statements, or had simply asked us, they would know that IBM has already announced the company has just taken a $600 million charge for workforce rebalancing.  \"This equates to several thousand people, a mere fraction of what's been reported. \"Last year, IBM hired 45,000 people, and the company currently has about 15,000 job openings around the world for new skills in growth areas such as cloud, analytics, security, and social and mobile technologies. \"This is evidence that IBM continues to remix its skills to match where we see the best opportunities in the marketplace. IBM was founded in 1911 and adopted the name International Business Machines in 1924. It currently creates hardware and software, and provides infrastructure, hosting and consulting services.

Silicon Valley journalist Robert X. Cringely, author of The Decline and Fall of IBM, says the notices could go out as soon as next week after IBM reported shrinking profits for an 11th quarter. IBM stock falls 7% after it downgrades earnings forecast The tech giant, which relies on service contracts for a significant portion of its cash flow, is suffering as companies shut down their internal data centres and move services to the cloud. IBM could lay off 26 per cent of its workforce of 430,000, which would mark the largest corporate layoff in history. Big Blue holds the previous record for huge cuts, after laying off 60,000 workers in 1993.  Cringely predicts the bulk of the layoffs will be in the U.S., and affect mainframe and storage divisions. Citing unnamed sources inside IBM, he says the company has been planning a reorganization dubbed Project Chrome to boost its earnings. IBM recently announced the new Z13 mainframe, but that is unlikely to protect jobs in the mainframe division. It also bought cloud services provider Softlayer and is opening cloud data centres around the world, including one in Canada, in an effort to move to a new business model. However, it is behind rivals such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon in adapting to cloud computing. Cloud offerings at IBM are expected to bring in $3.1 billion on an annualized basis in 2014, only a fraction of IBM\u2019s total $100 billion in revenue last year. In his book, Cringely blames poor management and lack of vision for IBM\u2019s decline.", "label": "observing"}

RelatedIBM inks $1.25bn cloud computing deal with WPPLenovo Buys IBM's X86 Server BusinessApple-IBM Deal: Why iPad-Maker is Doubling Down on Enterprise In his report on Project Chrome, Cringely says that those affected by the cuts \"will all be gone by the end of February\". He said that while there would be a significant number of jobs lost in the US, the axe would fall on all of IBM's locations around the world. The cuts in the US are likely to affect the company's mainframe and storage divisions most dramatically. Falling revenue Currently the record for the largest single corporate lay-off is also held by IBM, having fired more than 60,000 of its workforce in 1993, but this would be dwarfed if Cringely's predictions come true. Last year Microsoft hit the headlines when it had its largest ever jobs cull when it laid off more than 18,000 staff in one go. IBM's problems were underscored last week when it announced another set of weak quarterly revenue figures, its eleventh straight quarter of declining revenue. Following those results, CEO Ginni Rometty said the company was in transition but made no mention of the huge job cuts: \"We are making significant progress in our transformation, continuing to shift IBM's business to higher value, and investing and positioning ourselves for the longer term.\" IBM's problems stem from the fact that customers are moving their storage infrastructure to the cloud, meaning they no longer need physical data centres on site and therefore don't need service contracts with IBM to help maintain them - a business which accounts for two-thirds of IBM's revenue.", "label": "for"}

FEATURED RESOURCE Presented by Jive Software 10 Commandments of Collaboration for Exceptional Customer Service Read this whitepaper to discover best practices that drive brand affinity, repeat business and LEARN MORE The report comes from long-time Silicon Valley journalist Robert X. Cringely, who recently published an eBook on IBM's issues entitled The Decline and Fall of IBM. He blamed past CEOs Louis Gerstner and Sam Palmisano for making the mess and current CEO Virginia Rometty has done nothing to address them. The problem is a complex mess of bad management \u2013 like laying off important people in the middle of a project \u2013 to getting sidetracked with pie-in-the-sky ideas like commercializing Watson and failing to adjust to the new era. The \"M\" in IBM may mean machines, but hardware is less than 10% of its business. Two-thirds is in services, and the services pipeline has dried up. Why? Well, according to an ex-IBMer I spoke to some time ago, who confirmed what Cringely wrote in his book, IBM is still wedded to services contracts in an age where companies are shutting down their internal data center entirely and moving everything to the cloud. If you don't have a data center, you don't need an IBM service contract to manage it.  That's why IBM grabbed Softlayer, the cloud services provider. It needed to get into the cloud fast because it was behind Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Since the purchase 18 months ago, IBM has put a huge amount of money into SoftLayer and there has been a number of announcements around SoftLayer services. Cringely said the mainframe and storage areas will see deep cuts, which is pretty stupid considering IBM announced the new Z13 mainframe and hopes it will stimulate sales. That won't be easy when you cut the people who are supposed to sell it. Cutting storage is also foolish, as we are in the era of Big Data and Data Lakes and storage is vital to these concepts. And you have to wonder what a layoff of 110,000 people will do to the firm. That has to be jarring. I remember an old advertisement from the print days that said \"What's worse, getting laid off on a Friday or being told to pick up the slack on the following Monday?\" This will be undeniably upsetting to the survivors, who will likely spend time updating their LinkedIn profiles. The question I have to ask is why isn't Rometty one of the 110k. IBM has seen 11 straight quarters of declining revenue and it's hemorrhaging customers, according to both my source and Cringely. It's becoming apparent she is not up for the job and can't pull the company out of its nose dive. Cringely said the layoffs will begin next week and by the end of February, all of the employees will be gone. If nothing else, IBM's first quarter numbers will take a monstrous hit from the severance packages for 111,000 employees. To say nothing of what this will do to its customer confidence.", "label": "for"}

Those employees will all be gone by the end of February.\u201d An IBM spokesperson in the UK declined to comment on Cringely\u2019s report. IBM, known as Big Blue for its once-ubiquitous corporate logo, has struggled to make the transition from manufacturing computers and microchips to the world of cloud computing. Last week, Ginni Rometty, chief executive since 2012, reported quarterly profits below analysts\u2019 forecasts and an 11th straight quarter of falling revenues. Annual revenue fell to $93bn (\u00a362bn) last year from $107bn three years earlier as the company shed businesses such as its unprofitable chip design and manufacturing arm. IBM, once an industry pioneer, is still the world\u2019s biggest computer technology company, but it has failed to produce income from consulting, security software and analytics to make up for declining revenues from its old operations. Cringely predicted big cuts in the workforce at IBM\u2019s US mainframe and storage operation that would damage its ability to serve customers. He alleged project chrome was an accounting exercise to flatter IBM\u2019s results with cost cuts while business disappears from the group\u2019s top line. IBM\u2019s critics have accused the company of managing its results for years using tax-reduction schemes, outsourcing and non-standard accounting to keep earnings growing. The company last year scrapped a $20-a-share earnings target. The goal was set in 2010, shortly before Warren Buffett decided to invest $10bn in IBM.", "label": "against"}

Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama.

The media outlet reports that at least two ISIL jihadists have been publicly executed for spying and embezzlement in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal. It is still unclear whether the men were beheaded or crucified, since both forms of punishment are widely used by the Islamic State militants. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, one of the executed fighters was charged with \"banditry and robbing Muslims' money\" and the second one was accused of \"dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen,\" as cited by the Independent. Experts say they are not surprised by the harsh methods used by the IS, as decapitation and crucifying are common forms of punishment practiced by Sunni Wahhabi sectarians. \"Jihadist groups have a strict no corruption policy, meaning that while they can benefit financially from charging bank transactions and claiming a percentage of everyone\u2019s monthly income, they don\u2019t extort people like some secular groups have done in the past,\" notes Charlie Winter.

(RELATED: ISIS Massacred Every Man And Boy Over 15 In Muslim Town) It\u2019s not yet clear whether the ISIS extremists actually have Ebola or another disease. Ebola symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and unexplained bleeding and bruising \u2014 problems which could also be attributed to malaria or yellow fever. And doctors in Mosul might be unable to even test for Ebola. WHO spokeswoman Christy Feig said the organization is reaching out to officials in the ISIS-held area to offer help if the disease does turn out to be Ebola. However, United Nations workers are not allowed to work in ISIS-controlled areas in either Iraq or Syria, so a UN operation to help either ISIS militants or any civilians in the areas who contract Ebola is unlikely. Feig told Mashable that there\u2019s been no official notification from the Iraqi government that the terrorists\u2019 disease is, in fact, Ebola. ISIS is against western science and medicine as a rule, but apparently several militants have taken to hospitals with Ebola-like symptoms anyway. Since taking control of Mosul in June 2014, ISIS has taken to executing doctors that refuse to treat them. Kurdish news website Rudaw reported in Nov. 2014 that ISIS executed six doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded fighters, in addition to kidnapping six merchants for failing to pay a monthly tax to ISIS. The group reportedly executed two more doctors just last week. The U.S. has been hitting ISIS with air strikes since mid-November and the Pentagon confirmed in December that the strikes have killed around 1,000 fighters, including three senior ISIS officials.

However, Ebola symptoms \u2014 nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising \u2014 are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses and the Marburg virus. Also, most confirmed Ebola cases in this recent outbreak have originated in West Africa. Citing an unnamed source in a Mosul hospital, Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said the disease arrived in Mosul from \"terrorists\" who came \"from several countries\" and Africa. While ISIS has recruited foreign fighters, very few of them \u2014 if any at all \u2014 are believed to have traveled from West Africa. The majority of the Islamic State's African fighters came from Tunisia, according to a Washington Post report.

Local newspaper al Sabaah has claimed that the virus was brought to Mosul by terrorists arriving from several countries in Africa. As of the end of 2014, the total death count from the largest Ebola outbreak in history stands at 7,890 people, while over 20,000 have been diagnosed with the disease, for which there is no cure. The West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been the hardest hit. While the former two have seen the transmission rate go down significantly in the past couple of months, Sierra Leone remains in a fierce battle to contain the virus. ISIS captured several cities across Iraq and Syria in 2014, and has been seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region. Confirmation of Ebola cases will likely be difficult, however, as U.N. workers are prohibited from entering militant-controlled areas. The militants have become known for executing prisoners, including women and children, and giving Christians and other religious minorities an option to convert to Islam, pay a tax or be killed. Over a dozen doctors have reportedly been executed by ISIS in recent weeks for refusing to treat their injured fighters. The Daily Mail pointed out that there is no information on whether doctors still working in Mosul are trained or equipped to fight a possible Ebola outbreak. Since Ebola shares symptoms with other diseases including malaria and yellow fever, it is also possible that the cases so far have been misdiagnosed. It is also not know how many fighters from West African countries could have joined ISIS, though tens of thousands of foreigners and several other jihadist groups have reportedly rallied under the Islamic State banner.

Citing anonymous sources in a hospital in Mosul, Al-Sabah reported that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS were confirmed by health authorities in Mosul. The newspaper also claimed that ISIS recruits from some African countries brought the virus to Iraq. The International Business Times UK also carried a similar report, quoting Iraqi news sources. But a spokesperson for the Iraqi health ministry, Ahmed Rudaini, has denied reports that two cases of Ebola virus infection were diagnosed among ISIS militants in Mosul. The Iraqi health ministry spokesperson said the infection couldn't have been confirmed in Mosul because none of the hospitals in the city have the diagnostic facilities. He said only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the ability to confirm cases of Ebola virus infection. Responding to inquiries from Mashable, a WHO spokesperson, Christy Feigh, said, \"We have no official notification that it is Ebola.\" Feigh said the WHO was investigating the reports and would give assistance if needed. But because UN workers are banned from entering ISIS-held areas in Iraq and Syria, it is unclear how the organization would be able to confirm the report or render assistance in suspected cases. Mashable, however, reports that a Kurdish official who appeared convinced that the reports were accurate told the Kurdish news outlet Xendan that the militants reported at the hospital in Mosul with symptoms of Ebola virus infection. While Iraqi health officials are probably not taking the reports seriously, an outbreak of Ebola among ISIS militants could have serious consequences due to lack of access to the ISIS-held areas. It is also feared that ISIS militants could use the presence of the virus among its militants as a terror weapon against opponents, further complicating the prosecution of the war against the extremist group. However, the symptoms of Ebola virus, including vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding in the late stages of the disease are similar to those of several other diseases, including malaria, yellow fever and typhoid fever. Thus, it is possible that the militants who reported at the hospital in Mosul were suffering from other diseases that have symptoms similar to Ebola. Given the fact that the reports were carried exclusively on pro-government newspapers, it is not possible to rule out that they were designed to cause confusion among ISIS fighters and discourage new recruits from joining the group. It is not known that ISIS has a significant number of recruits from West African countries where the epidemic has been reported. Thousands of foreign recruits to ISIS arrived mostly from North African countries such as Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Algeria and Somalia where there have been no reports of Ebola outbreak. The Ebola virus epidemic has claimed thousands of lives in the West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Recently, Nigerian news sources reported that ISIS was making efforts to recruit fighters from the country. The report led the Nigerian government to issue a statement urging some Middle Eastern countries to carry out thorough background checks on Nigerians applying for visas. The report that some ISIS militants might have contracted Ebola comes a few weeks after Benjamin T. Decker, intelligence analyst and Iraq specialist with the Middle East research firm Levantine Group, said that ISIS executed about 11 doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded militants. Mosul was among several cities ISIS fighters captured earlier in the year 2014. The militants declared an Islamic caliphate in the areas they captured. Mosul, in particular, has been under ISIS control since June 2014. The city has reportedly suffered food, water and power shortages since extremist militants took over. Residents have suffered brutal treatment with reports of executions and enslavement of minorities women and children. On Wednesday, the US and its allies carried out 17 airstrikes in Syria and 12 in Iraq.

Ebola's potential appearance in Mosul was reported by three separate media outlets yesterday. Mosul is 250 miles north of Baghdad and has been controlled by IS since June, 2014. Al-Sabaah, an Iraqi newspaper, said two cases of Ebola and 26 of AIDS were reported in the city. Citing medical sources, it claimed the virus had been transported from \"terrorists\" who came \"from several countries\" in Africa. WHO director of communications Christy Feig said there has been \"no official notification\" from the Iraqi government that Ebola has been confirmed. The organisation is trying to contact Iraqi officials to see if help can provided to investigate any suspected cases in rebel-controlled areas of the country. Meanwhile a Kurdish official told media outlet Xendan the fighters\u2019 symptoms were similar to those experienced by Ebola sufferers. However, the effects of Ebola can resemble those caused by a number of illnesses, including malaria and Lassa and Yellow Fever. They include nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, bleeding and bruising. Middle East-based intelligence analyst Benjamin Decker said IS's killing of medics and its decision to ban Westerners from its territory could allow Ebola to spread rapidly. He said: \"United Nations workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria. \"In this context the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.\" Hundreds of Britons are believed to have to travelled to join IS forces, with some already heading home. Security and intelligence services monitor those who come back to see if they have renounced the terror network\u2019s barbaric regime or whether they remain suspected terrorists plotting UK atrocities. However, the current system may not equip security services for motoring symptoms of the Ebola, according to the WHO, has killed around 8,000 people in West Africa and affected areas so far.

Therefore, he said, the reports that Ebola has infected anyone in Mosul are \"incorrect\" and \"unfounded.\" The discussion started with an article in Iraq's official newspaper, Al-Sabah, that said \"terrorists\" brought Ebola to Mosul. \"Many diseases and epidemics have spread among residents of the city of Mosul,\" it read. \"Two Ebola and 26 HIV/AIDS cases were registered.\" Ebola is primarily a threat in West Africa, where its latest outbreak has killed nearly 8,000 people. Mashable reported ISIS has not recruited fighters from any countries severely affected by the disease. Its African members are primarily from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia. In the event ISIS does have Ebola, the militants could use it as a biological terror technique, Forbes reported in October. Members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others. \u201cThe individual exposed to the Ebola virus would be the carrier,\u201d national security professor Al Shimkus told Forbes. \u201cIn the context of terrorist activity, it doesn\u2019t take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.\u201d ISIS, a body of militants labeled a terrorist group by the United States and European Union (among others), has controlled Mosul since June.

Members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others.   \u201cThe individual exposed to the Ebola virus would be the carrier,\u201d national security professor Al Shimkus told Forbes. \u201cIn the context of terrorist activity, it doesn\u2019t take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.\u201d *  *  *", "label": "observing"}

Survivors of an Iraqi army regiment in Saqlawiya, near Fallujah, say the radical group used the gas against the besieged soldiers. There were conflicting government statements about whether the gas had been used. The siege on the regiment, which consists of nearly 400 soldiers, has created an uproar in Iraq, with Iraqi members of parliament (MPs) on Sept. 21 demanding the government break the siege.  The following day, the Anbar Operations Command said it opened the road to Saqlawiya, ending the siege of the soldiers. These statements seemed to be an attempt to ease the anger of MPs and the public at security leaders for leaving the soldiers besieged without any support. The incident came shortly after the massacre in the Speicher military base in Tikrit, where nearly 1,700 Iraqi air force cadets were killed. The investigations are still ongoing, as the victims\u2019 families continue protests, blaming security leaders for failing to protect the lives of the cadets. The testimonies of the survivors from the Saqlawiya incident, which were posted on YouTube, have shown the extent of negligence on the part of security leaders toward the soldiers, as well as the lack of serious attempts to save their lives as the siege lasted five days. The biggest surprise in the testimonies was that IS has chlorine gas and used it against the besieged soldiers. The MP in Qadisiyah province south of Baghdad held a news conference in the Iraqi parliament, during which they blamed Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in his capacity as commander in chief of the armed forces. The soldiers who hail from the province have suffered from the neglect of military leaders, in spite of repeated appeals seeking protection for the service members. MP Ali al-Badri said, \u201cThree hundred soldiers were killed in Saqlawiya.\" Badri, citing survivors\u2019 testimonies, said, \u201cTerrorists used chlorine gas for the first time.\u201d Sabah al-Jouburi, a professor at Salahuddin University in Salahuddin province, said IS had used chlorine gas in its war against the army for the first time. Reports previously suggested IS has over the years obtained chemicals to be used in its war against the Iraqi government seize cities. Hisham al-Hashimi, an expert on terrorist groups, pointed Al-Monitor to \u201cthe use of chlorine gas by the group [now known as IS] in 2005, in the bombings of a popular market in Abu Ghraib.\u201d Hashimi said, \"In early 2014, IS was able to obtain large quantities of chlorine gas when it took control of water treatment plants in Fallujah and Saqlawiya, and in Mosul and Salahuddin following the fall of Mosul on June 10.\u201d Yet, Hashimi said it appeared that IS had not used chlorine gas \u201cin any direct or indirect fighting\u201d with the army. He said IS knows the gas is not that toxic, \u201ccan only kill in enclosed places, and loses its effectiveness when heat is generated from the explosion. It can only be used to induce intimidation.\u201d \u201cExperts have not been able to prove its use in the battles of southern Dalouiya and Saqlawiya,\u201d he added. Anbar police also said that chlorine gas had not been used on the soldiers in the province. While Maj. Gen. Ahmad Saddag al-Dulaimi, Anbar\u2019s police chief, told Al-Monitor by phone, \u201cWe heard news that IS used chlorine gas in the Anbar battles,\" he said, \"This news is unfounded, and chlorine gas has not been used during the battles at all.\u201d He added, \u201cIf it indeed had happened, we would have told all media outlets about it and announced it.\u201d On the other hand, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense said, \u201cTerrorist organizations used chlorine gas in some areas close to water treatment plants, but did not have an impact. For the gas to have a lethal effect, it should be used in mass quantities, which the enemy does not currently have.\u201d Although the ministry asserted that \u201cno injuries were reported for now in the regions where the organization used chlorine gas,\u201d it issued instructions \u201cfor the purpose of increasing security measures.\u201d In a statement obtained by Al-Monitor, the ministry advised the members of the armed forces and civilians to \u201ccover their faces with a wet cloth to protect themselves from the potential effects [of chlorine gas]\u201d in case they hear IS is using it.", "label": "observing"}

Kurds: IS offensive in Syria is genocide The number of refugees seeking shelter in Turkey from IS' advance across northeastern Syria has hit 130,000, Turkey said Monday. Residents fleeing the frontier town of Ayn al-Arab, known in Kurdish as Kobani, and its surrounding villages said the militants were executing people of all ages in the areas they had seized. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday up to 150,000 Kurds had been displaced - internally and externally - since IS launched its latest offensive against Kobani last Tuesday. It also said that clashes in the area overnight had killed 10 insurgents, bringing the number of IS fighters killed to at least 39. At least 27 Kurdish fighters have died. Meanwhile the Islamic State group called on Muslims to kill citizens of all countries taking part in the US-led anti-jihadist coalition by any available means, in a statement posted online Monday. \"If you can kill a disbelieving American or European -- especially the spiteful and filthy French -- or an Australian, or a Canadian or any other disbeliever... including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, then rely upon Allah, and kill him,\" said Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the group's spokesman. \"Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military,\" he said in the message, which was released in multiple languages. Adnani's message -- which was released in an Arabic audio recording, together with transcripts in other languages including English -- gave instructions on how the killings could be carried out without military equipment. \"Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him,\" the IS spokesman said. \"If you are unable to do so, then burn his home, car, or business. Or destroy his crops. If you are unable to do so, then spit in his face.\" Adnani praised militants in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, calling on them to \"cut the throats\" of those fighting for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. \"O America, O allies of America, and O crusaders, know that the matter is more dangerous than you have imagined and greater than you have envisioned,\" he said. \"We have warned you that today we are in a new era, an era where the (Islamic) State, its soldiers, and its sons are leaders, not slaves.\" \"We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted.\" And he mocked the US air campaign, saying \"Are America and all its allies from amongst the crusaders and atheists unable to come down to the ground?\" Addressing Obama, Adnani said: \"You claimed... that America would not be drawn to a war on the ground. No, it will be drawn and dragged. It will come down to the ground and it will be led to its death, grave, and destruction.\" IS has seized at least 64 villages around Kobani since Tuesday, using heavy arms and thousands of fighters. It executed at least 11 civilians on Saturday, including at least two boys, the Observatory said. \"ISIL (another term for IS) are continuing to advance. Every place they pass through they kill, wound and kidnap people. Many people are missing and we believe they were kidnapped,\u201d Welat Avar, a doctor, told Reuters by telephone from Kobani. A Kurdish politician from Turkey who visited Kobani on Saturday said IS' offensive is comparable to a genocide. \u201cRather than a war this is a genocide operation ... They are going into the villages and cutting off the heads of one or two people and showing them to the villagers,\u201d Ibrahim Binici, a deputy from Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish HDP party, told Reuters. Waiting for Obama's General Assembly speech The head of the Syrian parliament, Mohammad al-Jihad, called on Sunday to the United States to cooperate with Damascus in the fight against IS rather than form an alliance with countries that support terrorism, referring to Saudi Arabia and other countries that support Syrian opposition groups seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad. Meanwhile, the United States, which has carried out airstrikes against IS in Iraq, has said it is prepared to extend them into Syria. US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said on Sunday that other countries were willing to join Washington in launching air strikes in Syria against IS militants. \u201cWe will not do the air strikes alone,\u201d she told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \u201cBut we\u2019re going to leave it to other nations to announce for themselves what their specific commitments to the coalition are going to be.\u201d Power told ABC's \"This Week\" there was universal support for \"degrading and destroying\" Islamic state. \"I will make you a prediction,\" Power said. \"We will not do the air strikes alone if the president decides to do the air strikes.\" Obama will give a speech at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday to make the case again for world action against Islamic State.", "label": "observing"}

The diagnosis: poisoning by chlorine gas. The perpetrators, according to the officers: Islamic State extremists. The chlorine attack appears to be the first confirmed use of chemical weapons by the Islamic State on the battlefield. An Iraqi Defense Ministry official corroborated it, and doctors said survivors\u2019 symptoms were consistent with chlorine poisoning. It is one of three crude chlorine attacks that Iraqi forces say have occurred since the extremists seized vast tracts of Iraqi territory this summer, although details on the other two incidents remain sketchy. The reported assaults raise concerns that the militants are attempting to hone their chemical weapons capabilities as they push to seize more ground. The presence of a large former Iraqi chemical weapons production plant in territory seized by the Islamic State has compounded those fears, though officials and chemical weapons experts say the 2,500 degraded rockets filled with nerve agents that remain there are unlikely to be fit for use. Weapons inspectors sealed them off with concrete in a bunker more than 20 years ago. The Islamic State\u2019s reported chlorine attacks appear to have been largely ineffectual. The attack on the police officers last month is the only one officially documented. Chlorine, a common component in industry, is sold legally, but its use as a weapon violates the Chemical Weapons Convention. It was widely employed in trench warfare during World War I, including infamously at Ypres in Belgium, where German forces dispersed more than 160 tons of chlorine into the breeze, killing thousands of French and Allied soldiers. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said last month that chlorine gas has been used \u201csystematically\u201d as a weapon in villages in northern Syria. The U.S. government has blamed those attacks on the Syrian government. But it has been years since the chemical has been used in fighting in Iraq. It was 4:20 p.m. on Sept. 15 when the 11 police officers were rushed into the hospital emergency room in Balad. Some struggled to stand; tears streamed from their eyes. \u201cThey were panicked; we were panicked,\u201d said Kasim Hatim, the hospital\u2019s director. \u201cWe initially thought it might be a more serious gas, a nerve gas or an organophosphate.\u201d The men had been brought in from the front lines of the nearby town of Duluiyah. Tucked into a bend of the Tigris River, the town had been under heavy assault for days, according to the accounts of three survivors. Islamic State fighters had taken territory to the north, cutting the only direct land access to the river town, and had blown up the last bridge into the town. The police officers, all members of the Sunni Jabbour tribe, which has turned against the Islamic State, were guarding a line in the town\u2019s north. After an exchange of fire, they said, they were surprised to see Islamic State fighters retreating from their position about 150 yards away. Suddenly there was a boom in the area the extremists had just vacated, said Lt. Khairalla al-Jabbouri, 31, one of the survivors. \u201cIt was a strange explosion. We saw a yellow smoke in the sky,\u201d he said. The wind carried the fog toward their lines. The men say it hung close to the ground, consistent with the properties of chlorine gas, which is heavier than air. \u201cI felt suffocated,\u201d Jabbouri recalled. \u201cI was throwing up and couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d Another officer, Ammer Jassim Mohammed, 31, who suffers from asthma, said he passed out within minutes. The men were taken to a small clinic in Duluiyah, before being transferred by boat to the larger hospital in Balad, where they were treated with oxygen and hydrocortisone, an anti-inflammatory medication, until the symptoms began to subside. They were all discharged the following morning. The four physicians who treated them said there was no question that chlorine gas was to blame. One physician on the team, Hassanain Mohammed, had treated similar cases before. In 2006 and 2007, al-Qaeda in Iraq, a group that later morphed into the Islamic State, carried out a string of chlorine bombings in the country. Mohammed was on duty at a Baghdad hospital one day during that period when dozens of victims were brought in after a bombing in Taji district, just north of the capital, in which insurgents had packed a truck with explosives and two one-ton chlorine tanks. There have been no confirmed accounts of the use of chlorine gas as a weapon in Iraq since then. An Iraqi Defense Ministry official confirmed this week that a bomb rigged with chlorine canisters was used in the Duluiyah attack. \u201cThey use it just to create terror,\u201d said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to provide the information publicly. \u201cBut of course we are very concerned.\u201d In a statement, the Defense Ministry confirmed that the Islamic State has used the gas in a \u201cprimitive and ineffective way\u201d near water treatment plants where it has gained access to chlorine, as well as in roadside bomb attacks. It did not specify the locations of the attacks, but there are several water plants near Duluiyah on territory controlled by the Islamic State. The extremist group aims to dent \u201cthe morale of the Iraqi people in general and our armed forces in particular,\u201d the statement said. It said that soldiers should be provided with gas masks as a precaution and that volunteers and civilians should place a dampened cloth over the nose and mouth to protect themselves during any attacks. The defense official said he did not have details of any incidents other than the Sept. 15 attack, while a U.S. official said he had no reports of the use of chlorine by the Islamic State. \u201cWe aren\u2019t aware of any chlorine attacks against the [Iraqi security forces] but would refer you to the Iraqi government to see what they might have,\u201d said Army Maj. Curtis Kellogg, a spokesman for Florida-based U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for U.S. security interests in the Middle East. Chlorine bombs are an easy-to-create but inexact weapon, experts say. All that is needed is a small explosive charge to rupture containers filled with the substance. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to deliver on target in combat situations,\u201d said Jean Pascal Zanders, an independent researcher who specializes in chemical and biological weapons and disarmament. \u201cChlorine dissipates fast unless someone is able to concentrate it in a confined area.\u201d Fighters in Duluiyah say it was not the only time chlorine has been used against them. Another attack this month caused minor injuries, and the fighters were treated locally, police officials said. Immediately after the September attack, the Balad hospital put in orders for thousands of doses of atropine, used to treat nerve-gas exposure, Hatim said. A thousand have been shipped across the river to Duluiyah. Soldiers who escaped an Islamic State rout of a besieged army base in Saqlawiyah, where hundreds of soldiers were killed last month, also said chlorine gas was used there \u2014 though reports of where and how the gas was delivered varied and could not be confirmed.

That's the latest question on the minds of North Korea watchers amid a storm of rumors that have built up in the weeks since Kim's last public appearance on Sept. 3. Other rumors suggest he is being treated for gout and that he has been hospitalized due to a cheese allergy. With so little hard news leaking out of the Hermit Kingdom, it's impossible to confirm any of this \u2014 including the rumor that Kim's little sister, Kim Yo Jong, is the new show-runner. But there is evidence that she has upped her political profile over the past few years, and she may be one of the few people on the planet with direct access to North Korea's leader. Here's what we've been able to mine. The two were born to Ko Yong Hui, a mistress of former North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Il. Kim Jong Un was the middle child of this relationship, second to an older brother, while Kim Yo Jong is the former supreme leader's youngest child. Image: RIA Novosti, Dmitry Astakhov, Presidential Press Service/Associated Press The pair grew up in Ko Yong Hui's residence in Pyongyang as well as in Switzerland, where they both attended school for some time, and have a \"very good relationship,\" Michael Madden, who operates a blog called North Korea Leadership Watch, told Mashable. At one point, the two appeared in the same school recital. She may have started working for the Korean Workers Party, the political establishment of which Kim Jong Un is the leader, around 2008, when her dad still ran the country. She reportedly worked to clear the way for her older brother to succeed her father once he died, though that's about all we know about their relationship. Kim Yo Jong was born on Sept. 26, 1987. By the time she was eight she was off to Berne, Switzerland, to attend school near where her older brothers were doing the same. She came back to North Korea roughly four years later, but not much is known about her activities until 2008, when she began to participate in the country's politics. \u201cShe was one of the only ones that was distinctly interested in politics, in North Korean politics,\" Madden said. Her father, according to Madden, used to go around telling his friends about his daughter's sharp political mind. Kim Yo-Jong, Kim Jong Un's younger sister..thought to be now running DPRK. pic.twitter.com/qTw0VP0e2t \u2014 North Korea (@NorthKoreaNews1) October 7, 2014 Like many things about Kim Yo Jong and North Korea in general, her role in politics isn't clear. She may have started working for her father or her aunt back in 2008 as a \"junior\" member of the party, according to NK Leadership Watch. When succession plans were finalized for her father's eventual passing, the powers that be reportedly gave her a significant part to play, possibly a position within her dad's personal secretariat or on the National Defense Commission. She became a member of her father's inner circle by 2011, and that carried over to her brother's inner circle when Kim Jong Un took the reins later that year. \u201cShe can get [Kim Jong Un] on the telephone, she can see him in person, that kind of thing,\" Madden said. NK Leadership Watch has written that Kim Yo Jong plans her brother's appearances, \"including his itineraries, schedule, logistical needs and security arrangements.\" This past March state media reportedly listed her as a senior official within the party \u2014 a first, according to the blog. It's not much to go on, but Madden said that reports of turmoil at the top in North Korea are probably exaggerated. This is less likely to be a coup \u2014 and more likely, he said, that Kim Yo Jong is relaying her brother's orders while he takes a break. But that doesn't mean the world should take their eyes off the little sister. \u201cKim Jong Un is not a micromanager,\" Madden said. \"It\u2019s very possible she could be running a lot more things than we think.\u201d Have something to add to this story?

According to NKIS on October 1, Kim Jong-un \u2014 who has failed to appear at official events since early September \u2014 is getting medical treatment at Bonghwa Clinic from both domestic and foreign medical teams. Meanwhile, in his absence,  Kim Yo-jong is charged with handling important government decisions. An unnamed source told NKIS that a decision to give Kim Jong-un extended medical treatment was made at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea on September 6. The meeting was reportedly held at Kim Yo-jong\u2019s suggestion. As a result of the meeting, Pyongyang decided four things. First, to give special and extended medical treatment to Kim Jong-un in order to quickly restore his health. Second, all North Korean high level officials and party members should be responsible in following Kim\u2019s previous orders. Third, the party and army should be on wartime-like alert while Kim Jong-un is out of commission. Lastly, all the important matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better. Kim Yo-jong is the daughter of the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and his wife, Kim Yong-hui. She was first spotted at a photo session for participants at the 3rd Conference of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea in September 2010, when she stood next to her father\u2019s personal secretary. She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, as she accompanied her brother in voting for the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly. She was identified as a \u201csenior official\u201d of the Central Committee of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea. She is widely seen as having taken over the role of her aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, the wife of the executed Jang Song-thaek. Kim Kyong-hui supported her elder brother Kim Jong-il during his rule. \u201cSome say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People\u2019s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,\u201d said Kim Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS. Meanwhile, speculation over Kim Jong-un\u2019s sustained absence continues unabated. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unnamed source, that he is suffering from gout. A Daily Mirror report said that Kim Jong-un is addicted to Swiss cheese, which may have contributed to his health problems. Curtis Melvin, a researcher with the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, told Foreign Policy that Kim Jong un spends much of his time at the family compounds in Wonsan and Kangdong. The family compound in Kangdong is where Kim Jong-il recovered from his stroke. In addition, Free North Korea Radio (FNK) reported on September 29 that Kim hadsurgery on his ankle. The surgery was reportedly successful. However, the South Korean government has refused to confirm that Kim is suffering from any health problem. \u201cI think it is hard to relate Kim\u2019s absence to his health since there used to be a time when Kim disappeared from official events [for] over ten days,\u201d said Lim Byeong-chul, a spokesman of the Ministry of Unification.", "label": "for"}

He has not been seen publicly in more than a month.  Rumors are flying that Kim is ill with gout, diabetes, even possible problems with his ankles. Now, a group of defectors say they believe Kim's younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, may be running the country while he recuperates. The North Korea Intellectuals' Solidarity, a think-tank run by defectors, says Kim Yo Jong may be at least temporarily leading the government. The group has not revealed the source of its information, and CNN cannot independently confirm it. But Kim Yo Jong's star appears to be rising. Why has North Korea decided to talk now? Michael Madden, who runs the blog North Korea Leadership Watch, says Kim Yo Jong has been identified in North Korean media as deputy director of the Workers' Party, a very powerful position. Victor Cha, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously handled the North Korea account with the National Security Council, says Kim Yo Jong began surfacing publicly earlier this year at party functions. \"Clearly it's an effort to slow-track her into becoming somebody who is important within the system,\" Cha says. \"I can see how it's possible that she's in some sort of temporary position. It's very difficult for the North Korean system to run without one of the Kim family at least titularly in charge. So, if Kim Jong Un is indisposed, she's really the only available body that's left, in terms of a direct Kim family line.\" Is Kim Jong Un still in charge of North Korea? Who is Kim Yo Jong? Madden says Kim Yo Jong was born in 1987 or 1988, and attended private school in Switzerland with Kim Jong Un. They both stayed at the North Korean embassy while attending the Swiss school, Madden says, and lived there under assumed names. Madden says Kim Yo Jong is the youngest of seven siblings their father, Kim Jong Il, had with four women. Many of them are half-siblings, but Kim Jong Un and Kim Yo Jong have the same mother. Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge Madden says Kim Yo Jong was always close to her father, and after returning from Switzerland, she was appointed to positions of responsibility in the government. She would act as an advance-team leader, inspecting sites before official visits, and had administrative duties as well. Now, he says, she continues those duties and has taken on more responsibility under her brother's rule: dealing with policy and receiving intelligence briefings. She acts \"almost like a White House chief-of-staff would,\" Madden says. He says he believes she had a large role in planning the recent trip by three top North Korean officials to South Korea while her brother was absent from the scene. Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge Ready for prime time? Given her age and that so little is known about Kim Yo Jong, North Korea-watchers are concerned about her being in the top leadership spot, if only temporarily. The stress and palace intrigue inside the North Korean regime, they say, may be overwhelming. \"If in fact she is running the country -- as someone in their early to mid twenties, to me that is quite alarming,\" Cha says. \"It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.\" All eyes will be on a significant event this Friday, October 10. That's the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party. Kim Jong Un attended the anniversary event last year. If he doesn't show up at Friday's ceremonies, concern over his public disappearance will only grow. If he does attend, intelligence analysts will be looking at his appearance, his body language -- every detail -- very carefully.

Dictator fails to show for key Communist event but does send a nice flower basket instead", "body": "The mystery surrounding North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's disappearance from the spotlight deepened today when he failed to show for a Workers' Party anniversary celebration. It was the first time in three years Kim hadn't attended the event in Pyongyang, which today marked the party's 69th anniversary. But while Kim wasn't there in person, a flower basket with his name on it was placed before statues of his father and grandfather, both of whom also ruled North Korea. Scroll down for video Kim Jong Un was absent from the Workers' Party 69th anniversary celebrations in Pyongyang today, but a flower basket baring his name was placed before statues of his father and grandfather, as were other baquets from North Koreans North Korean military personnel march as they visit the statues of late leaders, Kim Il Sung, left, and Kim Jong Il on Mansudae, as they mark the anniversary celebrations It was the first time in three years, Kim hadn't attended the event amid reports his sister has taken over leadership as he recovers from a leg injury North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo-jong (left), who has already been identified as Deputy Director of the Workers' Party, has reportedly taken leadership while her brother recovers from a leg injury His absence comes as speculation mounts that his sister, Kim Yo-jong, 24, who is Deputy Director of the Workers' Party, has taken over the leadership while her brother recovers from a leg injury. The 31-year-old hasn't been seen in public since September 3. He had been walking with a limp and was more overweight than usual in images that aired before that. An official documentary from late last month described him as dealing with 'discomfort', which led to international speculation that he may be ill. In Seoul, Unification Ministry spokesman Lim Byeong Cheol said that Kim appears to still be in charge of key affairs. He noted that a high-level North Korean delegation conveyed a greetings message to South Korean President Park Geun-hye during their surprise visit to South Korea last week. State media, later reported Kim was suffering from unspecified 'discomfort'. Sources have claimed the dictator had hurt his leg when he joined generals he had ordered to perform physical drills, and required 100 days to recover. North Korea has said nothing publicly about Kim's absence. But it is not the first time he has taken a break from the media spotlight - Kim wasn't seen publicly for about three weeks in 2012, South Korean officials say. He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship previously said Because Pyongyang is publicly acknowledging Kim's 'discomfort', many analysts believe that he's unlikely to be suffering from anything particularly serious. When his father, Kim Jong Il, suffered major health problems late in his rule, state media said nothing. But each day that passes only adds to the speculation. Kim missed a meeting of the country's parliament late last month, and was absent again from a gathering this week to mark his late father's election as ruling party head. Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, appeared to suggest Ms Kim had taken control. He told The Telegraph: 'Kim's sister may be young, but she has taken up some of the key leadership positions in North Korea, relying on the family name and bloodline to have her instructions carried out. 'No-one can touch the Kim family and it doesn't matter that she is young, inexperienced and a woman. She is a Kim and that's enough.' According to South Korea's JoongAng Daily, Ms Kim is already in charge of her brother's daily schedule, 'as well as coordinating every detail of his fashion and hair style'. Health fear: Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011 Prior to the emergence of the latest claims, a source with access to the secretive North's leadership insisted Kim was in firm control of his government, playing down speculation over his health and grip on power. The source said that Kim had just taken a step out of the limelight because of his leg injury. 'He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too,' the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 'They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon. 'He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. 'He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,' the source said. Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury. He was last seen attending a concert with his wife Ri Sol-ju on September 3 but has vanished from public since Kim has not been pictured by state media, which chronicles his whereabouts in great detail, since September 3 'The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,' said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble. Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from 'discomfort'. Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang. The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were 'rubbish'. 'It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,' said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia. North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye. Shots fired across border after activists urge North Korea to rise up against 'dictator' Kim North and South Korea exchanged machinegun fire today after the Communist state took objection to balloons loaded with leaflets condemning Kim Jong Un. No casualties were reported in the exchange of fire, a sign of the tensions which sill exist between the two states. They remain legally at war and are separated by the Demilitarized Zone, known as the DMZ. North Korean defectors launched balloons from the South today to send across leaflets and DVDs condemning the regime of Kim Jong Un, as well as American dollars The balloons carried bags of leaflets and anti-Kim DVDs underneath. But they prompted North Korean border troops to fire across the border, which led to an exchange of fire South Korean activists had sent leaflets critical of the North Korean regime flying into the North from the town, prompting shots to be fired by the North's guards to try to bring down the balloons. South Korea's military returned fire after hearing the sound of the North's machinegun fire, the official said. Some rounds fell on the South side which then responded with high-calibre machine gun fire 'towards the North's guard posts,' a defence ministry spokesman said. There was a further exchange of fire 10 minutes later, he added. Local residents of Hwangsan-ri township in the border area of Yeoncheon were evacuated to shelters as a precaution. While naval confrontations along the Koreas' disputed maritime border occur from time to time, any military engagement across the heavily-militarised land frontier is extremely rare. In 2010, the North shelled the South Korean border island of Yeonpyeong, killing four people and briefly sparking fears of a full scale conflict. The balloon launch from Hapsuri was one of several planned to coincide with North Korea's celebration today of the 69th anniversary of its ruling Workers' Party. Seoul allowed the exercises to go ahead, despite prior warnings from Pyongyang of 'catastrophic' consequences. Some of the balloons carried messages denouncing North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, who has not seen seen in public for more than a month. North Korea has reacted angrily to leaflet drops by South Korean private groups that carried messages attacking the authoritarian leadership in Pyongyang, vowing to attack them but has never taken action to follow up on the threat. 'This is the first time North Korea actually took an action against leaflets. It spilt cold water over the South-North relationship after the high-level delegation visit from North. It will strain the relations again,' said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said. On Tuesday, a South Korean naval ship fired warning shots after a North Korean patrol boat crossed a disputed sea border off the peninsula's west coast and fired shots back before retreating, a South Korean defence official said. There were no casualties on the South Korean side and none of the shots by either side was aimed at the other's vessel, he told Reuters. Evidence of the shots fired by North Korea could be seen on the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone which separates the two states, including this bullet hole (centre). Both sides are technically still at war", "label": "observing"}

Dressed in a black skirt suit, she was identified by commentators as \"comrade Kim Yo-jong\" and described as a senior official, a rank she has not previously been known to hold. She had been earlier seen in tears at Kim Jong-il's funeral in 2011 and has appeared sporadically alongside her brother over the past few years. Analysts said that her ascent in the party ranks signalled the increasing grip on power of Kim's family. Meanwhile the reasons for Kim's sustained absence from the public scene continue to be the subject of speculation. He was last seen on 3 September during a concert flanked by his wife. He was walking with a limp at the performance, sparking claims he has since undergone surgery for fractured ankles. Other reports suggested the Supreme Leader has been suffering from gout.

The saber-rattling North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month, spurring rumors he is ill and leading to speculation over who \u2014 if anyone \u2014 has filled the power vacuum in Pyongyang. But there's one atom bomb of a theory being mentioned by Korea watchers that's quickly gaining currency. Analysts believe 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, the seventh and youngest of Kim Jong Il's children with four women, has risen rapidly within the regime and may be secretly running the Hermit Kingdom \u2014 for now. Little Kim reportedly went to the same Swiss boarding school with Kim Jong Un and has held positions within the North Korean government since her father was in power. \"If in fact she is running the country \u2014 as someone in their early- to mid-20s \u2014 to me that is quite alarming,\" Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Victor Cha told CNN. \"It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.\" State TV showed Kim Jong Un uncharacteristically walking with a noticeable limp in July at the 20th anniversary memorial commemorating the death of his grandfather, the nation's founder. After the Supreme Leader's recent vanishing act, health theories have abounded. Kim is ill with everything from gout and a cheese addiction to ankle problems and diabetes. State media called what ails Kim \"discomfort\" in a Sept. 26 report. He may even be under house arrest, according to Remco Breuker, professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands. \"We're not sure where he is, or what's happening,\" Breuker told the ABC News. \"We don't know whether he's in the hospital or whether he's been put under house arrest.\" Kim Jong Un, whose pal Dennis Rodman said is 31, saw his waistline balloon since he ascended to power in late 2011, analysts note. Sis Kim Yo Jong is a senior official in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. But her role might have expanded dramatically if Kim Jong Un is incapacitated. \"She is one of the only people in (North Korea) that we know has unfettered direct access to KJU. At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper,\" North Korea Leadership Watch blog's Michael Madden told NBC News. Korea watchers point to Friday's anniversary of the founding of the Ruling Workers Party. If Kim Jong Un doesn't show, expect speculation to reach fever pitch. jmolinet@nydailynews.com Follow on Twitter @jmolinet ON A MOBILE DEVICE? CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO.", "label": "observing"}

There\u2019s several pieces of the news, with some indicating that the dictator Jong-Un may no longer be in control of the country. Jang Jin-sung, formerly a key member of Kim Jong-il\u2019s propaganda machine, said recently that a powerful group of officials that once reported only to Jong-il have stopped taking orders from Jong-Un and now effectively run the country. The group is called the Organization and Guidance Department, and some of them want to keep the status quo while others want to open up the market. \u201cOn one hand, it\u2019s people who want to maintain a regime monopoly,\u201d Jang told VICE News through a translator. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s not like people are fighting against the regime, but in a policy sense they want to take advantage to get influence. It\u2019s not actually consciously civil war, but there are these two incompatible forces at play.\u201d The insight comes as Seoul-based think tank North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity says that Kim Yo Jong may be leading the country instead of her brother. In this Wednesday, July 25, 2012 photo, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center, accompanied by his wife Ri Sol Ju, right, waves to the crowd as they inspect the Rungna People\u2019s Pleasure Ground in Pyongyang. (AP Photo/Korean Central News Agency via Korea News Service) The NKIS says that Jong-Un is getting medical treatment for an unspecified illness, and that the extended treatment was actually decided upon at a high-level meeting in early September that was held at Yo Jong\u2019s suggestion. She\u2019s now charged with handling important government decisions in his absence, according to the Diplomat, citing the report. \u201cAll the important matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better,\u201d the people at the meeting decided. Yo Jong is the daughter of Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, and his wife Kim Yong-hui, and was first spotted in public in September 2010. She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, being identified as a \u201csenior official\u201d in the government. Then again, perhaps Yo Kong is not in total control, according to Kim Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS. \u201cSome say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People\u2019s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,\u201d he said. The possible leadership change comes amid reports of an attempted coup. MORE: North Korea Lockdown? Is Pyongyang Actually Closed Off Amid Coup Attempt?", "label": "observing"}

Now, as the country\u2019s leader remains conspicuously absent from public life, it has been suggested that Kim Jong-un\u2019s younger sister may have stepped up to help him manage the daily affairs of leadership while he battles a bout of ill health. Along with Kim\u2019s wife, the former singer Ri Sol-ju, the 27-year-old is one of the country\u2019s most prominent women and has been photographed with her brother on public visits. However, it is her absence from the limelight that some believe adds weight to the theory that she may have taken over some, or even all, of the leadership responsibilities from her brother as he recovers from his \u201cphysical discomfort\u201d. \u201cIf Kim has indeed been set aside \u2013 and nobody outside Pyongyang really knows \u2013 then whoever has taken power is not seeking the limelight,\u201d said John Everard, former UK ambassador to Pyongyang.\u201cThe visits to factories and military units that Kim frequently conducted have not been taken over by anyone else; they have simply stopped.\u201d \u201cAs a woman in a very male-dominated society, the theory goes, she might be reluctant to push herself forward publicly straight away, preferring instead to bide her time while governing from behind the scenes.\u201d However, Everard says though it is \u201cnot impossible\u201d that Kim Yo-jong has stepped up to the leadership, \u201cit is as hard to disprove this theory as it is to find anything to support it\u201d. Kim Yo-jong, whose name is also spelt Kim Yeo-jung, is believed to act as an adviser for her brother, as other members of the Kim family have done relatives did previously for both him and his father, the late leader Kim Jong-il, before him. Her elder sister, Kim Sul-song, for example, held a key role in the party\u2019s powerful propaganda department under their father. Their aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, was similarly influential until she fell out of favour last year after her husband \u2013 Kim\u2019s former mentor \u2013 was executed. She is now believed to be in hiding. In the absence of independent media inside the secretive state, speculation about what lies behind Kim\u2019s absence, and whether he is still in power, continues. \u201cThe young leader\u2019s absence certainly does deepen our questions about how their system might change or operate without him,\u201d said Adam Cathcart, a lecturer in history at Leeds University and editor of North Korea news and analysis website Sino-NK.com. He too expressed doubts that North Korea might have quietly seen a woman take supreme power for the first time. \u201cWithout Kim Jong-un in the forefront, North Korea\u2019s government [remains] a highly conservative patriarchy run by old men for whom Moscow 1956 is the standard for dangerous liberalism. Regardless of who is in charge, it will keep the world on its toes \u2013 one thing that the state does extremely well.\u201d", "label": "observing"}

Yesterday was the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party of Korea. Since taking over the top leadership position after the death of his father, longtime ruler Kim Jong-il, in late 2011, the younger Kim had marked the beginning of this important national holiday by leading top military and party officials on a midnight visit to the Kumsusan mausoleum in Pyongyang. By Friday morning, the state-run media had made no mention of such a visit, which would have taken place at midnight on Thursday. The gigantic Kumsusan Palace of the Sun \u2014 where the mummified bodies of Mr Kim\u2019s father and his grandfather, the founding president of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, lie in state \u2014 is among the most sacred places in the country. During the anniversary last year, Mr Kim and his wife also attended the performance of a national choir and the dedication of new buildings. If he did the same this year, the news would probably have been reported in the North Korean media. No public appearance by the leader has been shown in the media since Sept 3. Speculation escalated after the state-run Korean Central Television confirmed that Mr Kim was not feeling well and showed him limping during a visit to a factory in August. He was first seen limping on North Korean television in July. While he was absent from public view, Mr Kim continued his work, sending letters to young party cadets and workers, state media said. South Korean officials and analysts have said the young and obese North Korean leader may be suffering from health problems, such as gout. One Seoul-based website, run by North Korean defectors, recently reported that many of Mr Kim\u2019s daily duties had been taken over by his younger sister, Ms Kim Yo-jong, while he was being treated for health issues caused by his excessive eating and drinking. A source with access to Pyongyang\u2019s leadership said on Thursday that Mr Kim is in firm control of his government, but had hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises, reported Reuters. The source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing, said: \u201cHe ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part, too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon.\u201d \u201cHe injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning, but the injury worsened,\u201d the source told Reuters. But on the Internet, bloggers were spreading rumours, with no evidence, that Mr Kim, believed to be about 30, might have been sidelined by a coup engineered by some of the old disgruntled generals.

Or not.", "body": "If North Korea's Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un, is not running the Hermit Kingdom, then who is? That presumes, of course, that the 30-something leader has run into serious health problems, physical or political, and no one yet knows that for sure -- only that he has remained out of public view for five weeks. But in the opaque world of North Korean politics, that's enough to start a serious guessing game. While North Korean officials quietly let the word filter out this week that Kim is doing just fine with an injured ankle, that hasn't quelled speculation on who might grasp the reins of power if they slip -- or have slipped -- from his chubby hands. There are only a handful of possible pretenders to the throne, but perhaps the most intriguing is 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, who wields the ultimate trump card as youngest daughter of the late departed leader Kim Jong Il and granddaughter of the founder of the country, Kim Il Sung. A think-tank operated by North Korean defectors, the North Korea Intellectuals' Solidarity, says she may be directing the government, at least temporarily. As with most top figures in North Korea, particularly members of the Kim family, little is known of Kim Yo Jong, and much of that is a compilation of snippets of information. One of the most extensive bios comes from Michael Madden, who runs the blog North Korea Leadership Watch. He says Kim Yo Jong was been identified in the North Korean media as deputy director of the Workers' Party of Korea, a powerful position indeed. It was the first explicit mention of her in a state media report as a senior party official -- and a sign of her ascension. Madden also says she works as an aide to her brother, Kim Jong-un -- something of a chief of staff -- running his public events, itineraries and logistical needs. In addition, she has ties to the Guard Command and Ministry of State Security. Her biggest foray to the West came as a child when she attended elementary school in Berne, Switzerland from 1996 to 2000, using the name \"Kim Yo'ng Sun\" and living in the North Korean Embassy. Her brother, now Supreme Leader, was also studying nearby. Madden says that some photos of her as child were captured on home video by other parents at the school. Kim Yo Jong has made periodic appearances in public, notably in December 2011 at various events held for her deceased father, Kim Jong Il. She has also been shown in the North Korean media in the background while her brother visits hospitals or children's camps, and can be seen sitting in the elite arm chair section reserved for high officials, though on the second row, at a concert attended by her brother. Madden also says he believes she played a large role in planning Hwang's recent trip to South Korea, raising speculation as to which of these powerful figures had the upper hand in pulling it off. \"She is one of the only people in [North Korea] that we know has unfettered direct access to (Kim Jong Un),\" Madden tells Global Post. \"At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper.\" Victor Cha, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who handled the North Korea portfolio with the National Security Council, tells CNN that if Kim Yo Jong, at age 27, is in fact running the country \"it means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.\" Among those already wielding power is Hwang Pyong So, who has moved up quickly under Kim Jong Un as vice marshall of the Korean People's Army and new chief of the General Political Bureau of the KPA. Most important, he is vice-director of the Organization and Guidance Department for the Workers Party of Korea, a post that finalizes appointments within North Korea's leadership. Hwang's rapid rise makes him chief beneficiary of a series of recent high-level military purges, including the arrest and execution of the Supreme Leader's uncle, Jang Song Theak, a four-star general. Last weekend, Hwang, who is believed to be around 65 years old, led a North Korean delegation on a surprise visit to South Korea, ostensibly to visit the Asian Games, where North Korean athletes were participating. The delegation reportedly gave the South Koreans only one day's notice. Hwang, decked out in his high-peaked cap, also held closed-door talks with top South Korean officials and agreed to restart long-stalled peace talks between the two countries, which are still technically at war. Hwang's position atop the military structure offers considerable clout in a highly structured, tightly controlled North Korea and makes him a prime contender for the top spot. Of course, in a secretive world like North Korea, powerful figures may well operate out of the shadows. One clue to the pecking order, though, is a favorite of old Cold War Kremlinologists -- seeing who sits next to whom at public events. One well-placed figure, literally and figuratively, has been Gen. O Kum Chol, who was shown in July sitting two seats away from Kim Jong-un at a volleyball game. As Vice Chief of the KPA General Staff, O Kum Chol's portfolio includes military strategy and planning as well as relations with foreign militaries. He is also a member of the central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and deputy of the Supreme People's Assembly, which gives him considerable clout. On the other hand, the guy sitting between him and Kim Jong Un was none other than Hwang Pyong So. Until Kim Jong Un's status is clarified, the speculation will continue.", "label": "observing"}

A senior ministry official said that Verma, who had joined CPWD as an Assistant Executive Engineer in 1980, went on Earned Leave in December, 1990 and did not report to work thereafter. Verma went on seeking extension of leave which was not sanctioned and defied directions to report to work. An inquiry was instituted against him in September, 1992 for major penalty for wilful absence from duty. Due to non-cooperation of Verma with the inquiry and for other reasons, it got delayed and a fresh charge sheet was issued in 2005. The inquiry report, establishing the charges was submitted in July, 2007 and the same was accepted by the then Minister of Urban Development in August, 2007.

His friend took him to the hospital while his wife stayed home with their three children. In Roche's case, the eggnog may have literally gone down the wrong pipe, Dr. Robert Schilz of University Hospitals in Cleveland explained. The eggnog, which was booze-free, may have crept into Roche's windpipe, triggering pneumonia. Roche spent a full day in the ICU and two more days recovering at the hospital. \"It was not fun,\" Roche said. \"It took me a full week of recovery to be 100 percent.\" Nearly two weeks later, he says the jokes won't stop at work. \"People are emailing me pictures of eggnog ... it never gets old,\" he said. \"I'm pretty competitive but, unfortunately, in this situation it got the best of me.

Often, there's a lot of heavy drinking. One overly zealous drinker in Utah County nearly killed himself a couple of weeks ago, winding up in the hospital for three days. Even though the drinks at the party contained no alcohol, a heavy drink nearly put Ryan Roche out of commission for the holidays. \"I think it was one of those spur of the moment kind of things,\" Roche said. As his holiday office party wound down earlier this month, Roche headed for the door with his wife and kids. \"They busted out some eggnog.\" An eggnog-chugging contest was getting started, and one of Roche's colleagues called him out to compete. Roche said he's a competitive guy and couldn't walk away. \"I've already decided, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to win,\" he said. The record at that point was 22 seconds. There was a Ruth's Chris Steak House gift card on the line, so Roche faced off against two other co-workers. \"I just opened up my throat, didn't even swallow,\" he said. \"I pretty much poured it down.\" I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably. I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant. \u2013Ryan Roche As the video shows, he drank a quart of eggnog in just 12 seconds, without taking a breath. \"I got done, and I was gasping, I couldn't breathe.\" Roche said he was coughing a lot as he headed home, but thought he would be OK. A couple of hours later, he wasn't so sure. \"I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably,\" he said. \"I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.\" He asked a friend in medical school to come over to his house and check on him. The friend took him to the hospital. Roche had aspirated the eggnog to his lungs and was essentially \"dry drowning,\" the doctors told him. \"They pretty much had to wheelchair me in, double IV, oxygen, and hooked me up to what they call the nuclear weapon of antibiotics,\" he said. The liquid in his lungs was starting an infection. He spent 24 hours in intensive care with a fever, sweats and chills. \"It was rough,\" he said. \"Eggnog: not ideal for the lungs.\" On day three in the hospital, doctors took him off oxygen, and he went home. After about a week, he was back at full strength. It was a holiday mishap he'll never forget, and also probably never live down.

Though he shattered the contest record, an infection started in his lungs and he spent three days in the hospital. His competitive Christmas spirit nearly killed him. After being pressured into an eggnog-chugging contest at an office party, a Utah man nearly died from an infection that started in his lungs. A YouTube video shows triumphant Ryan Roche down a carton of eggnog in a record 12 seconds, shattering the previous record of 22 seconds. For his victory, he received a gift card to a local steak house - and a trip to the hospital. Roche told the Daily News he was actually about to leave the Dec. 10 holiday soiree with his family when the organizers broke out the eggnog. A colleague called him out, and the competitive Roche refused to walk away. Without even sparing time to taste it, the sales manager finished the quart of eggnog in record time -- but Roche said he immediately knew there was a problem. The Lehi resident had done other chugging competitions in the past without incident, but as soon as this one ended, he couldn't breathe. In the video, he's seen bending over after finishing the drink. Afterward, he coughed a lot and had trouble breathing as the thick holiday drink blocked his airways. A few hours later he decided to go to the hospital. \"Initially I felt very nauseous and pretty sick,\" he said. \"After I was put on antibiotics and an IV I was no longer nauseous.\" But Roche spent three full days in the hospital. Because he'd breathed in the eggnog, the liquid caused an infection in his lungs. \"The next few days my body would change from having a fever to shivering nonstop,\" he said. \"It was like every hour on the hour it would change.\" About a week after being discharged from the hospital, Roche said he was back to full strength and feeling good. His unusual illness also made him a celebrity inside the hospital. \"I can't tell you how many doctors or nurses would walk into my room and say, 'Eggnog, huh?' Then they'd say, 'Well, at least you won,'\" he said. And the experience has not completely soured him on eggnog. \"I was never a big fan of it to begin with,\" he said. \"I could drink it again, but it's not my drink of choice.\" And though he is proud of his record, Roche said he will not be defending his title at future parties. \"No chance,\" he said. \"Even if someone challenged me to do it, my wife wouldn't allow it.\" USING A MOBILE DEVICE?

Taibbi's abrupt disappearance from the company's Fifth Avenue headquarters has cast doubt on the fate of his highly anticipated digital publication, reportedly to be called Racket, which First Look executives had previously said would launch sometime this autumn. When he was hired, amid much fanfare, Taibbi's website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by First Look, an ambitious digital journalism company funded by Omidyar, the founder of eBay and one of the richest tech moguls in America. Like its counterpart the Intercept, launched earlier this year by Glenn Greenwald and others to pursue investigations of NSA surveillance and the intelligence world, it was a venture centered around a brand-name polemicist without much management experience. Prior to joining First Look, Taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for Rolling Stone \u2014 most famously, he described Goldman Sachs as \"a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity\" \u2014 and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the \"simultaneously funny and satirical voice\" associated with the legendary magazine Spy. Over the succeeding months, the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well, and it brought on a number of high-profile names from the New York digital scene, including deputy editor Alex Pareene, formerly of Salon; Laura Dawn, a digital video producer who formerly worked with Moveon.org; and Edith Zimmerman, founding editor of the Hairpin. \"Journalists should be dark, funny, mean people,\" Taibbi told New York in an interview in March. \"It's appropriate for their antagonistic, adversarial role.\" Omidyar originally conceived of First Look as a network of interlinking sites run by \"independent\" journalists, many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism. Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple \u2014 a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii \u2014 to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi. The confrontational approach that made Taibbi's name at Rolling Stone \u2014 and before that, as the founding editor of the gonzo Moscow expatriate magazine The eXile \u2014 appears to have contributed to internal trouble at First Look. Sources confirmed that Taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks, only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff. Although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of Taibbi's absence, the launch date for Racket \u2014 which Taibbi indicated in September would be coming \"in a month\" \u2014 now appears to have been pushed off. \"We have a target date but I wouldn\u2019t make a launch date public,\" said Temple, who is based in San Francisco, when reached by phone this morning. \"I don\u2019t comment about internal matters and I don\u2019t comment on personnel matters. ... I mean we\u2019re a private company, so why would we ... no.\" Taibbi's absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look, which Omidyar founded last year, originally in response to the disclosures of NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden to Greenwald and his Intercept colleague Laura Poitras. Omidyar initially committed $250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused \"digital magazines.\" In July, the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being, choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism. The Intercept has lately been publishing vigorously, breaking several major stories \u2014 federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the government's voluminous terrorist watch list. But Racket has been much slower to materialize, leading to rumors of staff anxiety. In August, Temple told me Taibbi's site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches \u2014 not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism. For instance, Ellen Miller, head of the campaign finance watchdog the Sunlight Foundation \u2014 a nonprofit also heavily financed by Omidyar \u2014 met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics. \"We're supporting Matt in creating something unique \u2014 and it's Matt's,\" Temple told me. \"He's building a team and there's great esprit in Matt's team.\" Taibbi's clashes with those at the top are likely to drive further speculation about the fate of the long-incubating project and about the journalist's own continued involvement. Nonetheless, the site is apparently still hiring.", "label": "for"}

The \u201cleave of absence\u201d also comes three months after I first reported that Omidyar had apparently ordered Taibbi to change his strategy away from purely covering corporate fatcats (like, uh, Pierre Omidyar) to a wider mission, involving more comedy than reporting. Around the same time I heard rumors that Eric Bates was also unhappy at the organization. I\u2019ve previously had a\u2026 uh\u2026 spirited email conversation with Taibbi about both claims, although Taibbi would only engage on the condition that his words were \u201cnot for publication\u201d \u2014 a strange demand coming from an editor at a site that\u2019s about leaking confidential documents. I emailed Taibbi again today to ask if I can publish his responses in the light of today\u2019s news. He replied: \u201cNo, you may not.\u201d Here then, for what little it\u2019s worth, is my side of the correspondence, from back in July, in which I laid out the state of First Look as I saw it (with a little help from some well placed sources.) The discussion was\u2026 uh\u2026 spirited on both sides. All words below are mine \u2014 you\u2019ll just have to try to infer what Taibbi\u2019s stated position might have been. A note on not for publication / off the record: I thought carefully about the ethics of publishing even my half of a \u201cnot for publication\u201d conversation. Given First Look\u2019s own policy of publishing confidential documents and the fact that it seems clear Taibbi wasn\u2019t being entirely truthful about his place at the company, I ultimately came down on the side of publishing my own responses, with Taibbi\u2019s words redacted. I\u2019m sure some readers with disagree \u2014 I welcome the discussion. Also, an important disclosure: Taibbi previously worked with Pando\u2019s Mark Ames on Russian ex-pat newspaper, the Exile. It has been widely reported that the two are no longer on speaking terms. I didn\u2019t discuss this post with Mark before publishing. Ok, here are the emails\u2026 [The email thread began with Taibbi's emailing me to deny that Omidyar had changed his strategy. I had emailed First Look for comment on my story before publication but received no reply. Taibbi's email was headed \"Not for publication.\"] From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 [Redacted Taibbi quote, denying my story] Right, but that\u2019s not the part that seems to have changed. What\u2019s changed is that Omidyar\u2019s description of the site yesterday made zero mention of wall street. It\u2019s gone from finance first to politics first. More broadly, and happy to stay off the record, there\u2019s clearly something weird going on over there. Why does a 250m journalism project have to shift focus before it\u2019s launched? It suggests PO has no clue how to handle talent and so is retreating back to technology. [Taibbi responded, with questions of his own. Here's my reply...] From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 I don\u2019t think [Omidyar] took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over. Knowing what I do about his management style I\u2019m leaning towards the latter. But I emailed you because I actually want to understand what\u2019s going on. [Taibbi responded again. And I replied again...] From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 [Redacted.] If I waited for Pierre and his staffers to respond to questions I\u2019d never publish a thing about First Look. I\u2019ve given PO 48hrs to respond before, and still got nothing. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve always held stories indefinitely until you receive a response? As for your bizarre chain of straw man arguments \u2014 I didn\u2019t say he\u2019d hired you to shut you up. So, no, I don\u2019t [believe] something you just made up. As you say, that would be real [redacted] analysis. Here\u2019s what I believe\u2026 I don\u2019t think Pierre has any idea why he hired you, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re entirely sure either. Perhaps he was looking for names that looked good on a press release and you fit the bill. I think you\u2019re tired, and I think you knew the Rolling Stone gig wasn\u2019t going to last for ever. I think PO offered you complete editorial freedom and promised you a blank check to build your own team. For that reason, I think Omidyar\u2019s announcement yesterday should be terrifying to you, and to anyone else who works at FLM. He\u2019s lost his nerve \u2014 for a combination of reasons \u2014 and is retreating to something he understands: Technology and platforms. I\u2019ve spoken to people who have known Omidyar for decades and people who have worked with him on previous publications \u2014 if you seriously think he\u2019s going to have your back when you go after his pals you\u2019re more naive than\u2026 well, than you are. I\u2019m tired of this conversation now. I honestly can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re being a team player, or if you believe any of this crap. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll continue to cover FLM and I\u2019ll continue to ask for comment when I do. It\u2019s entirely up to you if you respond before publication or wait until afterwards and then bitch on Twitter. Either way, I\u2019ll continue to read your Wall St stuff if/when you publish it \u2014 just as I read, and enjoyed, your most recent book on a long flight a few weeks back. Best of luck, Paul [Taibbi responded again.] From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Wed, Jul 30, 2014 I\u2019m tired of it because you refuse to actually engage in conversation. I\u2019ve laid out my position, clearly and honestly, and asked follow up questions. You won\u2019t actually address any of my points \u2014 you just keep lobbing back straw men and not engaging with what I\u2019m saying. At the very least you\u2019ve turned into a corporate flack for First Look: Continuing to hammer away at a caricatured version of what I said, while refusing to answer questions, and demanding that the whole thing stay off the record so that readers continue to be left in the dark. The last person who tried that line of attack over a Pando story was Lanny Davis. [Redacted] I\u2019ve told you what I believe, but I\u2019ll humor you \u2014 and your enjoyment at playing PR flack \u2014 by saying it again, this time line by line\u2026 [Redacted Taibbi quote] I think it\u2019s unlikely Pierre *ordered* you to stop writing about Wall Street. I\u2019d say the odds [are] almost zero. He\u2019s not that fucking stupid. Here\u2019s what I said \u201cNo, of course I don\u2019t think he took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over.\u201d Here\u2019s my question, which you don\u2019t seem keen to answer: Did you know Pierre was going to leave finance out of his post about what your editorial mission would be? If not, doesn\u2019t that worry you? If so, what is the reasoning behind not mentioning the thing that you are best known for but which is likely to make your sole funder and boss the most uncomfortable? A follow-up question: What are we to make of the fact that First Look journalists \u2014 Greenwald in particular \u2014 insist that Pierre has no control over editorial (indeed you\u2019ve insisted similar in this conversation) and yet he\u2019s the one laying out the company\u2019s editorial plan? Why wouldn\u2019t that be the job of the actual editors? Instead we have your $250m funder issuing a statement that marginalizes the one aspect of your work that might sting him while reassuring the world that \u2014 don\u2019t worry! \u2014 he intends to permit you and Greenwald to continue doing your jobs, but that he has decided to axe plans for all the other editorial sites he previously (in a video starring him) said he would fund. What does the phrase \u201ceditorial independence\u201d actually mean at First Look? [Redacted Taibbi quote] I think that\u2019s what he told you when you were first hired, yes. People are told lots of things on first dates. [Redacted Taibbi quote] I\u2019ve never said otherwise. That\u2019s a total red herring. [Redacted Taibbi quote] [Redacted] I didn\u2019t mention anything in my story about Pierre ordering you to stop writing (because, as I\u2019ve made clear, I don\u2019t believe that would make any sense); I didn\u2019t mention what I suspect you might have been told when you were hired (because, again, I don\u2019t know. What I know \u2014 and what I wrote \u2014 is that the public statements about your mission have changed); I didn\u2019t mention it being a satirical publication because that hasn\u2019t changed. [Redacted Taibbi quote] A press release about what your job and focus will be, written by the man who writes your pay checks and who is backing down on almost all of the editorial strategy that was in place when you were hired. A press release that was at odds with all previous statements about what your focus will be; specifically leaving out the one thing that would seem to have the potential to make Omidyar most concerned. Yes, I believe that means you will be focussing far less on that aspect of things and, yes, I believe that it\u2019s either a choice you\u2019ve consciously made, or a choice Pierre is attempting to make for you through passive aggressive public messaging. Your choice of denial is interesting. \u201c[Redacted]\u201d That\u2019s the same line Greenwald used when he was challenged on whether he would write about Pierre\u2019s business interests. Clear enough to sound like a denial, but general enough to allow you to focus most of your energies away from Wall Street. Do you at least concede that previously the chief focus of your site was to be on finance and now it\u2019s on politics and \u201cculture\u201d? If the *main focus* of the site still on uncovering financial corruption? Yes or no? If yes, why did your boss mischaracterize the site so badly in his blog post, and if no, why not? [Redacted Taibbi quote] Pierre has been interfering with First Look\u2019s editorial plans from the start. Every single editorial plan First Look has exists only at Pierre\u2019s pleasure. He is your sole funder and he is the one making public statements about how he intends to allocate those resources. How is it possible you understand Wall Street so well but don\u2019t understand that? [Redacted Taibbi quote] Yes, that is what\u2019s apparent from Omidyar\u2019s statement. [Redacted Taibbi quote] I had plenty of information, and printed what I knew, after giving you the opportunity to respond before publication. I\u2019d have plenty more information to set the record straight if you\u2019d answer any of the questions above. Or better still, stop hiding behind \u201cnot for publication.\u201d Why, if you\u2019re being so unfairly maligned, won\u2019t you let any of the above be shared with readers? Isn\u2019t the whole basis of First Look to make all the information public and let readers decide? Why doesn\u2019t that apply to conversations about First Look and its billionaire owner? Which leads me to my last question: Have you, or any first look staffer to the best of your knowledge, signed an NDA or non disparagement contract \u2014 either as a standalone or as part of your employment contract(s)? You\u2019re right, this is an enjoyable conversation! Now let\u2019s shift it up a gear and get to some real answers. Paul Despite previously saying he was enjoying our conversation, Taibbi stopped responding when I asked him he had signed any kind of contract restricting his freedom to talk openly about First Look.

The author describes a scene that he allegedly witnessed, in which a prophet and teacher that he names I\u0113sous de Nazarenus, resuscitated a stillborn boy and handed him back to his mother. Historian and archivist Ignazio Perrucci, was hired by the Vatican authorities in 2012, to sort, analyze and classify some 6,000 ancient documents that had been uncovered in the gigantic archive vaults. He was already very excited when he noticed that the author of the text was the famous Roman historian Velleius, but he was completely stunned when he realized the nature of the content. Professor Perrucci found the text in the archives of the Vatican, while searching amongst a bundle of personal letters and other trivial documents dating from the Roman era. The text as a whole is a narrative of the author\u2019s return journey from Parthia to Rome that occurred in 31 AD, recorded in a highly rhetorical style of four sheets of parchment. He describes many different episodes taking place during his trip, like a a violent sandstorm in Mesopotamia and visit to a temple in Melitta (modern day Mdina, in Malta). The part of the text that really caught M. Perrucci\u2019s attention is an episode taking place in the city of Sebaste (near modern day Nablus, in the West Bank). The author first describes the arrival of a great leader in the town with a group of disciples and followers, causing many of the lower class people from neighbouring villages to gather around them. According to Velleius, that great man\u2019s name was I\u0113sous de Nazarenus, a Greco-Latin translation of Jesus\u2019 Hebrew name, Yeshua haNotzri. Upon entering town, Jesus would have visited the house of a woman named Elisheba, who had just given birth to a stillborn child. Jesus picked up the dead child and uttered a prayer in Aramaic to the heavens, which unfortunately the author describes as \u201cimmensus\u201d, meaning incomprehensible. To the crowd\u2019s surprise and amazement, the baby came back to life almost immediately, crying and squirming like a healthy newborn. Marcus Velleius Paterculus, being a Roman officer of Campanian origins, seems to perceive Jesus Christ as a great doctor and miracle man, without associating him in any way to the Jewish concept of Messiah. Many tests and analysis have been realized over the last weeks to determine the authenticity of the manuscript. The composition of the parchment and ink, the literary style and handwriting have all been carefully scrutinized and were considered to be entirely legitimate. The dating analysis also revealed that the sheepskin parchment on which the text is written, does indeed date from the 1st century of this era, more precisely from between 20-45 AD. This new text from an author known for his reliability, brings a brand new perspective on the life of the historical character that is Jesus of Nazareth. It comes to confirm the Gospels on the facts that he was known for accomplishing miracles and that his sheer presence in a town was enough to attract crowds of people. A complete and official translation of the document should be made available online in many different languages over the next few weeks, but the impact of the discovery is already felt in the scientific community. Many scholars have already saluted the finding as one of the greatest breakthrough ever realized in the study of the historical life of Jesus, while others have expressed doubts about the conclusions of Professor Perrucci and demand for more tests to be performed by other scientific institutions before drawing any conclusions.", "label": "for"}

Reza Gul, a resident of Balabolok district of western Farah province, said she rushed to the small police outpost near her home after it came under attack early on November 17. She told NBC News she screamed in anger and grief when she saw her son Safiullah \u2014 who had been guarding the outpost along with a group of lightly armed policemen \u2014 shot dead. Then, she said, she took action. \u201cThe Taliban attacked our village and my son\u2019s outpost at dawn,\" explained Gul, who like many in Afghanistan does not know her exact age but who estimates she is between 50 and 60. \u201cAfter seeing my young son\u2019s body I picked up his gun and decided to fight off the killers of my son until I die.\u201d Gul spoke to NBC News by telephone from Farah, the capital of Farah Province. NBC News could not independently confirm Gul\u2019s account, although local police and media repeated similar versions of the incident. \u201cI fought them until dark along with other boys from the police, and [we] killed at least 25 of them,\u201d she added, saying that her husband, daughter-in-law, daughter and her teenage son also joined in and supplied her with ammunition. Gul's daughter, Fatima, told Afghan television channel Tolo News that she had prepared bullets for her father and mother to fight. \"We started a kind of family war against the Taliban,\" she said. Gul's daughter-in-law Seema told Tolo News that the fighting intensified when she reached the battlefield armed with a variety of light and heavy weapons, but that \"we were committed to fight until the last bullet.\" Provincial police chief General Abdul Razaq Yaqoobi confirmed that the Taliban had launched a heavy assault on Balabolok district on November 17 with an estimated 400 fighters. \"The police post in Abdul Satar village which was manned by 10 local police and commanded by a local police officer named Safiullah came under heavy shelling and the commander was killed in the gun battle,\" he said. He added that Safiullah\u2019s mother had joined the policemen after learning of her son's death and taken up his rifle. The mother's presence boosted the morale of policemen resisting the attack, Yaqoobi said, and after seven hours of heavy fighting the Taliban fled. At least 25 Taliban militants were killed and 31 injured in that village alone, Yaqoobi added.

In a new video released late Friday night, Abubakar Shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released. \"The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,\" he said, laughing. \"In this war, there is no going back.\" Nigeria's chief of defense staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, on Oct. 17 announced that Boko Haram had agreed to an immediate cease-fire to end a 5-year-old insurgency that has killed thousands of people, and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in northeast Nigeria. But attacks and abductions have continued, with the extremists this week seizing Mubi, a town of more than 200,000 people. Fighting also continued Friday in Vimtin, the nearby village where Badeh was born. Shekau in August announced that Boko Haram wanted to establish an Islamic caliphate, along the lines of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. Fleeing residents have reported that hundreds of people are being detained for infractions of the extremists' version of strict Shariah law in several towns and villages under their control. Boko Haram's kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls taking exams at a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April prompted an international campaign for their release and criticism of Nigeria's government for not acting quickly to free them. Dozens of the girls escaped on their own in the first few days, but 219 remain missing. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls has been used on social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter, in an effort to spark conversation about the kidnappings. Nobel Peace Prize laureate and international education activist Malala Yousafzai visited Nigeria in July, and urged Boko Haram to free the kidnapped girls, calling them her \"sisters.\" Unconfirmed reports have indicated that the girls have been broken up into several groups, and that some may have been carried across borders into Cameroon and Chad. The government had said it had negotiated with two Boko Haram leaders in Chad, with talks hosted by President Idriss Deby, and that it was confident the girls would be freed soon. But Boko Haram has many factions. Shekau's announcement further discredits the government of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who on Thursday formally announced his candidacy for elections on Feb. 14, 2015, in Africa's most populous nation. Nigeria, with some 160 million people, is divided almost equally between Muslims who dominate the north and Christians in the south. The West African nation is the biggest oil producer on the continent and has its biggest economy. Jonathan's failure to curtail the insurgency and many corruption scandals are not expected to dim his chances of success. The election, though, is expected to be the most hotly contested since his People's Democratic Party took power after decades of military dictatorship ended in 1994. Dozens of ruling party legislators have defected to the coalition All Progressives Congress, losing the PDP its majority in the lower house of Parliament. But the coalition is weakened by its inability to choose a presidential candidate, and primaries in December will be contested by three powerful northerners who all are Muslim. Jonathan, a Christian from a minority southern tribe, has been criticized for ignoring an unwritten party rule to alternate power between Christian and Muslim leaders, adding a religious and ethnic dimension to the election.

Badeh's announcement came after a senior aide to President Goodluck Jonathan, Hassan Tukur, told AFP that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as for the release of 219 girls held captive since April. But a precedent of previous claims from the government and military about an end to the deadly five-year conflict and the fate of the missing teenagers left many observers urging caution. Jonathan is also expected to declare his bid for re-election in the coming weeks, with positive news about the hostages and the violence likely to give him a political boost. Multiple analysts cast doubt over the credibility of a man called Danladi Ahmadu, whom Tukur claimed represented Boko Haram at the two meetings in neighbouring Chad. \"I have never heard of such a man (Ahmadu) and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group's leader Abubakar Shekau,\" said Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government. Ralph Bello-Fadile an advisor to Nigeria's National Security Advisor (NSA), told a conference on Monday that the NSA has been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau. \"Government wants to negotiate,\" he told a Chatham House event in Abuja, \"but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau.\" View galleryBoko Haram A screengrab taken on October 2, 2014 from a video released by Boko Haram and obtained by AFP shows  \u2026 - Chad talks - Tukur said he represented the government at two meetings with the Islamists in Chad, which were mediated by the country's President Idriss Deby. \"Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,\" said Tukur, adding that Ahmadu made the announcement on Thursday evening. \"They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,\" he continued, referring to the girls seized in northeast Nigeria on April 14, causing global outrage. Ndjamena refused to comment but security sources in the country said Chad, which Jonathan visited for talks with Deby early last month, had been involved in the discussions. The source also said a ceasefire agreement was reached as well as the release of 27 hostages, 10 of them Chinese nationals, who were kidnapped in northern Cameroon earlier this year. The release of the hostages last weekend was \"a first strong signal\" from Boko Haram to prove their good faith, the source added but did not mention the schoolgirls. - Discrepancies - Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group's \"chief security officer\" and in charge of publicity. He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau. He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means 'Western education is forbidden' which was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders. The insurgents themselves never use the term. The group's known leaders have exclusively used the name Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, which means \"People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad\". He made no reference to the Chibok girls and did not list the creation of an Islamic state in Nigeria's mainly Muslim north -- the core, unwavering Boko Haram demand since the uprising began. Shekau has in a series of video messages since 2012 ruled out talks with the government and said northern Nigeria will never know peace until sharia (Islamic law) is strictly enforced. Envoys from Nigeria's presidency have made similar ceasefire claims in the past, notably Jonathan's Minister for Special Duties Taminu Turaki, who led a so-called amnesty commission in 2013 that was tasked with brokering peace. Turaki on several occasions maintained that he was negotiating with legitimate Boko Haram commanders, including Shekau's immediate deputies, and that a ceasefire was at hand. But nothing materialised from Turaki's protracted negotiations. Shekau said that he never sent delegates to any talks and attacks continued at a relentless pace.", "label": "observing"}

But Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who has faced intense global pressure to free the students, said that\u2019s a trade he will not make. The Nigerian government has in the past misled the public about the girls\u2019 status; its fight against Boko Haram has been fraught with challenges since the militant group rose up in 2009, from inefficiency and corruption in the military to lax local support in the northern communities that are threatened most.

Al Jazeera's Haru Mutasa, reporting from Lagos, said details of the deal have yet to emerge. \"Both sides have agreed there will be no more attacks, no more bombs and no more attacks on Boko Haram.The government will not attack any Boko Haram strongholds for the moment.\" Mutasa said. \"We do know Boko Haram wanted certain conditions met, for example they wanted their senior commanders released from government captivity.\" Mutasa added. Abducted schoolgirls Sources told Al Jazeera that substantial progress had been reached in negotiations about the abducted girls but that no definite deal had been agreed.  Inside Story - Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram? A senior adviser to Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan told Al Jazeera that the deal reached on Friday included the release of the girls, but that no date had been set and that the release was part of an \"ongoing process\". Doyin Okupe said the government had agreed to \"some concessions\" but did not give any details. Boko Haram has been demanding the release of detained fighters in exchange for the girls. The group attracted international condemnation with the April abduction of nearly 300 girls from a boarding school in northeast Chibok town. Dozens escaped but 219 remain missing. Nigeria's president has been criticised at home and abroad for his slow response to the abducted and for his inability to quell the violence by the group, seen as the biggest security threat to Africa's biggest economy. Jonathan is expected to announce he will run for a second term in office on Saturday. Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as \"Western education is sinful\", has killed thousands of people in a five-year insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in the country's northeast.", "label": "observing"}

He said Nigerian soldiers would comply with the agreement. Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told BBC Focus on Africa that the agreement was sealed after a month of negotiations, mediated by Chad. As part of the talks, a government delegation twice met representatives of the Islamist group. Mr Tukur said Boko Haram had announced a unilateral ceasefire on Thursday and the government had responded. \"They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,\" he said. \"I am cautiously optimistic.\" He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at another meeting next week in Chad's capital, Ndjamena. The negotiations are said to have the blessing of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, reports the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja. Speaking to the BBC, Nigerian government spokesman Mike Omeri said Boko Haram would not be given territory under the ceasefire agreement - and that the government would not reveal what concessions it would make. \"We are inching closer to release of all groups in captivity, including the Chibok girls,\" he said. Analysis: Will Ross, BBC News, Lagos Nigerian officials had not given any indication that negotiations with Boko Haram were taking place. Even though there had been rumours of talks in neighbouring Chad, this is a very surprising development. Many Nigerians are extremely sceptical about the announcement especially as there has been no definitive word from the jihadists. The military has in the past released statements about the conflict in north-east Nigeria that have turned out to be completely at odds with the situation on the ground. So many here will only celebrate when the violence stops and the hostages are free. In May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan imposed a state of emergency in the northern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa, vowing to crush the Islamist insurgency. But Boko Haram increased its attacks this year. The group promotes a version of Islam which makes it \"haram\", or forbidden, for Muslims to take part in any political or social activity associated with Western society. It frequently attacks schools and colleges, which it sees as a symbol of Western culture. Who are Boko Haram? Who are Boko Haram? Profile: Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau Human Rights Watch has reported that 2,053 civilian were killed in the first half of the year, while Amnesty International estimated that 4,000 people were killed in violence - including Nigerian military operations - in the first seven months of 2014. Boko Haram is seeking to establish an Islamist state in Nigeria, but its fighters often cross the long and porous border with Cameroon. Eight Cameroon soldiers and more than 100 Boko Haram militants were killed in fighting in the far north of Cameroon on Friday, Reuters quoted the country's defence ministry as saying. In July, Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and Niger agreed to form a 2,800-strong regional force to tackle Boko Haram militants.", "label": "observing"}

Boko Haram has not yet responded to the government's announcement Thursday of a ceasefire, which an official said heralded peace in the country after some five years of conflict with the Islamic extremist group. In one attack, militants ambushed travelers in the Borno state village of Shaffa, residents of the area said, killing eight people and abducting others. Boko Haram gunmen also stormed the village of Waga in Adamawa state, abducting a number of residents, including women, residents there told CNN. Insurgents also occupied the town of Abadam, near Niger, after killing an unknown number of residents in their attack, residents said. Nigerian officials said Friday that the government had reached a ceasefire agreement with Boko Haram, which has been waging an insurgency in the country's north since 2009. The deal, the government said, includes the release of more than 200 kidnapped girls whose abduction from their boarding school shocked the world in April. The deal, first reported by Agence France-Presse, came Thursday night after a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, principal secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan. Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to Tukur. \"We have agreed on the release of the Chibok schoolgirls, and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group's representative next week in Chad,\" Tukur said. Doyin Okupe, a government spokesman, said the ceasefire deal was meant not only to free the girls but also to end the insurgency. \"On the war front, we can say there is peace now,\" he said Friday. What is Boko Haram? A source involved in talks with the militants told CNN last month that Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross had discussions with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the group for the more than 200 schoolgirls. It is unclear, however, whether the deal includes a prisoner swap. The name \"Boko Haram\" translates to \"Western education is sin\" in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials. \"Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?\" Abubakar Shekau said. \"They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.\" Shekau slammed reports of their planned release. \"We married them off.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to the aide. The ceasefire deal announced October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan. After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad. That day passed without any signs of the girls. Boko Haram a growing challenge In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more \"war, striking and killing with gun.\" This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead. Days later, members of the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria, residents said Thursday. Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said. For its part, the Nigerian government isn't backing down. Rather, it is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said on Saturday. The military claimed its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two of the states in northeastern Nigeria that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram. Officials are \"studying\" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said. Boko Haram, whose name translates to \"Western education is sin\" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state. The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government. As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been criticized by the girls' families for responding slowly to their abduction. Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates to \"Western education is sacrilege,\" seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Shariah law in northern Nigeria. During its early years, the Sunni militant group engaged in isolated skirmishes with Nigerian security forces. But after a bloody government crackdown in 2009, Boko Haram launched a broad insurgency. Last summer, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declared a calipate in the areas under his forces control. Boko Haram's insurgency has been characterized by a brutal campaign of bombings and shootings targeting Christian churches, Muslim mosques, schools, markets, bars, villages, police stations and even a UN building. An estimated 5,000 Nigerians have been killed and a further 300,000 displaced by the violence. In 2013, the Nigerian government declared a state of emergency in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa.

Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist who is considered close to Boko Haram's leaders, said he does not believe Ahmadu is part of the group\u2019s leadership or that he speaks for the group. \u201cI challenge Danladi Ahmadu to an open debate if he has d [sic] interest of Nigeria at heart. Who is he?\" Salkida wrote on Twitter. But Mike Omeri, the Nigerian government's spokesperson on the Boko Haram insurgency, told The WorldPost Saturday that the government is confident it has been negotiating with the right guy. \u201cThese talks did not just happen one sunny morning ... They approached the president of Chad, and if he wasn\u2019t confident [of Ahmadu\u2019s identity] he wouldn\u2019t have connected him with the president of Nigeria,\u201d Omeri said. \"The fact that this contact comes from Nigeria\u2019s neighbor gives us confidence.\" Chad has confirmed it is acting as a mediator in the talks to free the girls, who were kidnapped in the Nigerian village of Chibok in April. Since Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan visited Chad last month, rumors have grown that Nigeria's government was quietly negotiating the girls' release via its neighbor. It was not immediately clear how long the talks have been taking place. Boko Haram's leadership has not commented on the cease-fire. Meanwhile, Ahmadu himself has purportedly made at least two statements in recent days. On Friday, he gave an interview with Voice of America\u2019s Hausa-language service in which he didn\u2019t mention the kidnapped schoolgirls and was vague on the details of the cease-fire, Agence France-Presse reported. The news agency also noted that Ahmadu referred to the militant group as Boko Haram, a name used by outsiders but not by the insurgents themselves. On Saturday, Sahara Reporters said its correspondent in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri had obtained a CD recording of another statement by Ahamdu. This time, he was more precise. \u201cOn the girls that we took from Chibok, all that we want before we free the girls is to get justice from the Nigerian state because there are many of our members that their business premises were destroyed, some killed and others in detention and many other oppression,\u201d Ahmadu said, according to a translation from Hausa by Sahara Reporters. The news site\u2019s editors said they remain skeptical about his identity. As part of the deal, Omeri said, the talks taking place in Chad this week will address the release of the schoolgirls. Omeri added that the militants are motivated by a wish to reintegrate into society. \u201cThey are working towards peace in order to have a chance for them to return to normal things -- for example, many have businesses, \" he said. Asked whether Nigeria would consider releasing captured Boko Haram militants in exchange for the girls, Omeri said \u201cevery asset\" will be directed towards the girls' release. \"Everything possible is being done until the day they are freed,\" he said. \"Boko Haram want peace, they are ready for it and intend to have it implemented,\" he added. After the cease-fire was announced, suspected Boko Haram militants continued to attack communities in northeast Nigeria, leaving several dozen dead over the weekend. But Omeri insisted that the violence would not deter the negotiations. He suggested that militants in remote areas may not have heard about the cease-fire, or that the attacks could have been perpetrated by criminal opportunists, rather than Boko Haram members. Boko Haram is \"deeply fractured,\" according to the risk consultancy Stratfor, quoted in Reuters Sunday. Nigeria's government had a \"difficult time identifying a Boko Haram representative who could make compromises and guarantee the entire group will observe them,\" Stratfor said. \"It is quite possible that Abuja has reached an agreement with a legitimate representative of a specific cell ... that holds the kidnapped schoolgirls captive,\" the group added. In the kidnapped girls\u2019 hometown, the community hardly dared to hope that the girls might be finally returned. \"We don't know how true it is until we prove it,\" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok Local Government Area, told The Associated Press.", "label": "observing"}

Nigeria's military says it killed Shekau a year ago, and authorities said in September that they had also killed an imposter posting as him in videos. In the latest recording it is hard to see the man's face as he his filmed from a distance. But it is likely to raise grave doubts about whether talks between a Boko Haram faction and the government in neighboring Chad will secure the release of the girls, who were kidnapped from a secondary school in Chibok, northeast Nigeria, in April. \"We have have married them off and they are all in their husbands' houses,\" the man claiming to be Shekau says. \"The over 200 Chibok girls have converted to Islam, which they confess is the best religion. Either their parents accept this and convert too or they can die.\" The majority of the kidnapped girls were Christians. The man in the video also denied there was a ceasefire, and denounced Ahmadu, who says he represents Boko Haram in Chad. \"Who says we are dialoguing or discussing with anybody? Are you talking to yourselves? We don't know anybody by the name of Danladi. If we meet him now we will cut off his head,\" the man in the video says. \"All we are doing is slaughtering people with machetes and shooting people with guns ... War is what we want.\" He says also that they are holding a \"white man.\" The only known hostage seized in the northeast is a German teacher kidnapped from a college in the northeastern city of Gombe in July by gunmen widely assumed to be linked to Boko Haram. Shekau's denial of the ceasefire appears supported by the violence since the government announced it two weeks ago. It also raises doubts about the actual influence of Ahmadu. The five-year-old campaign for an Islamic state by Boko Haram, which has killed thousands and whose name means \"Western education is sinful,\" has become by far the biggest menace to the security of Africa's biggest economy and top oil producer. Its fighters have attacked targets almost every day for weeks and last week seized control of Mubi, the home town of Nigeria's defense chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh. It was Badeh who announced the ceasefire. They robbed banks, burned down houses and hoisted their black flag over the Emir's palace, killing dozens of people and forcing thousands to flee, witnesses in Mubi said. A car bomb thought to have been planted by Boko Haram killed at least 10 people at a crowded bus stop in Gombe on Friday morning, emergency services said. The government has blamed the violence on Boko Haram's allied criminal networks that it cannot control. There are also thought to be several competing factions within the group.

The little-known al Qaeda offshoot gained national attention in April when they abducted some 300 schoolgirls from a school in Chibok, northern Nigeria, to be sold as slaves. The abduction sparked international outrage and the social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls that enlisted the likes of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and countless celebrities.

Jennifer Cook, the director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the longer the girls stay in captivity, the harder it would be to bring them home. \u201cWith hostage situations with this many people, to bring one set back without endangering another set is very difficult,\u201d Cooke told Time. \u201cIn some cases, there\u2019s a pretty good idea of where they are, but extricating them from a group of armed criminals who have so little respect for life is a difficult negotiation process.

It appears as though the 219 school girls that are being held captive by Boko Haram will be released, although a Defence Ministry spokesman said that part of the negotiations still needs to be finalised. He was \u201cassured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well\u201d. Nigerian presidential aide Hassan Tukur told the BBC: \"They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them. I am cautiously optimistic.\" He said arrangements for their release would be finalised at a meeting next week in Chad. On April 15, Boko Haram \u2013 which means \u2018education is sinful' \u2013 raided a school in the remote north-eastern town of Chibok, kidnapping 276 school girls and women. Dozens escaped in the days after the abduction. This act brought the group international notoriety, with world leaders condemning the kidnapping and internet activists launching the global social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls. Boko Haram had demanded the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls, but Nigeria president Goodluck Jonathan would not swap prisoners. President Jonathan has come under fire in his country for failing to handle the threat of Boko Haram, which has reportedly killed 13,000 civilians in the years since 2009. After insurgent success, Boko Haram began seizing and holding territory in the northeast of Nigeria, declaring a caliphate similar to that of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In recent weeks, however, the Nigerian military has taken back towns from the extremists and is thought to have killed hundreds of Boko Haram militants. Mike Omeri, the Nigerian government\u2019s spokesman on the kidnappings, said: \"Already, the terrorists have announced a cease-fire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a cease-fire.\u201d \"Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously,\" a security source told Reuters. That source said, however, that it is unlikely that the ceasefire extends to all factions of the Boko Haram group. \"There are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group. I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire,\" the source said. The government was negotiating with Danladi Ahmadu, a man calling himself the secretary-general of Boko Haram, the presidency source said. It was not clear if Ahmadu is part of the same faction as Shekau. Boko Haram has not made a public statement. The Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria had for months been neglected by the western media following the emergence of Isis in the Middle East and more recently the Ebola outbreak in west Africa. But, on Monday, major British politicians signed a letter that called for action against Boko Haram, and for the rescue of their captives. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Lord Ashdown classed Boko Haram alongside Isis as a part of a \u201cgrowing, well-organised international terror network that poses a direct threat to UK national security.\u201d Additional reporting from Reuters", "label": "observing"}

However, restraint appeared to be the order of the day, with the details of any deal still hazy and no word yet from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau. Wild celebrations might have been expected at the apparent end of an ordeal that has lasted more than six months but they were not in evidence, with many cautious about what might happen. But officials have made clear that the return of the girls is part of the deal. \"We will know the negotiations were successful when we see the girls physically. And then we will know it is true. And then we will celebrate,\" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok's local government, told the Associated Press. Another resident, community leader Pogu Bitrus, told the news agency that \"people rejoiced, but with caution\". Some reports on Friday night suggested the girls, taken from a school in Chibok back in April, could be released as early as tomorrow in neighbouring Chad \u2013 but Reuters reported yesterday, citing two senior government sources, that the Nigerian government would be looking to secure the release of the girls by Tuesday. Yesterday Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, said the authorities are \"inching closer to the release of the Chibok girls\". He later told Reuters that \"discussions will continue in Chad next week, and on the basis of those discussions we'll have more details\" on the girls' release. The second source quoted by Reuters said that there might need to be further meetings in Nigeria or the Chadian capital N'Djamena to iron out the rest of the details for the deal. \"We have confidence in those we are negotiating with, but we are still doing it with considerable caution. Boko Haram has grown into such an amorphous entity that any splinter group could... disown the deal,\" he reportedly said. During its 12-year existence \u2013 the past five have seen the group trying to create an Islamic state in the north of the country \u2013 Boko Haram has been split. Doubts have been raised by some analysts about Danladi Ahmadu, the self-proclaimed \"secretary general\" of Boko Haram who was named by President Goodluck Jonathan's principal secretary, Hassan Tukur, as the Boko Haram's representative in the talks. Ahmadu gave an interview to Voice of America in which he confirmed the ceasefire that was officially announced by Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, the head of Nigeria's military forces, on Friday. In the interview Ahmadu appeared to say that he had not even met Abubakar Shekau. This is not the first time a ceasefire has been called, hence the trepidation on the part of families in Chibok. In July 2013, when a government minister announced an agreement, Shekau quickly denied it using a video message \u2013 his preferred means of communication. He said that whoever the government negotiated with did not speak for him, and that he would never talk to infidels. Leaders of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, which gained the backing of politicians and public figures worldwide \u2013 including the US First Lady, Michelle Obama \u2013 summed up the mood. \"We are really cautious because there have been many times that such optimism has been expressed but did not materialise,\" Obi Ezekwesili, a former education minister said in a TV interview on Saturday. \"But all the same, we are hopeful,\" she said, according to the AFP news agency. Quoted by the Leadership newspaper yesterday, the headteacher of the school from where the girls were taken, Asabe Kwambura, said she would be the \"happiest person in the world\" if the girls were to return President Jonathan has faced criticism over his response to the abduction of the girls \u2013 and Boko Haram's continuing insurgency. He was set to attend a rally in Abuja yesterday where he was expected to officially announce his candidacy for presidential elections next year, leaving some to question the timing of the ceasefire announcement. Publically, the President has also always said he would not release Boko Haram prisoners, a central demand of the group \u2013 but there has been speculation about such a deal. Other than the girls, some of whom have escaped back to their families in the months since they were taken, many in the northern provinces where Boko Haram have killed thousands during their insurgency will be hoping the ceasefire holds. However, yesterday there were reports that suspected Boko Haram militants had killed several people in a number of attacks on Nigerian villages that occurred after the ceasefire announcement, security sources and witnesses told Reuters.", "label": "observing"}

Women attend a demonstration in Lagos, Nigeria, calling on the government to rescue schoolgirls kidnapped by the radical Islamist group Boko Haram. Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, said there was also an agreement for the release of the captive girls following talks with Boko Haram representatives mediated by officials from Chad, new agencies reported. But Nigerian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade said the schoolgirls' release was still under negotiation, the Associated Press reported. Nigerian officials haven\u2019t commented on what was being offered to Boko Haram in return for the girls\u2019 freedom. The group has previously demanded the release of prisoners as a condition for freeing the hostages. Nigeria\u2019s military announced months ago it knew the location of the girls but said it would not launch a military operation to recover them because of the risk of casualties. A government spokesman, Mike Omeri, told a new conference Friday that Boko Haram representatives said during negotiations that the girls were in good health. Analysts were cautious about the news, with Nigerian officials reporting countless false dawns in its long confrontation with the militant group -- and with Nigeria facing presidential and parliamentary elections in February. Jonathan is expected to announce in coming weeks that he will run for a second term. There have been several efforts in recent years to negotiate peace with Boko Haram, which has battled the army for control of northern Nigeria and sought to impose a strict form of Islam in the region. None of the attempts has come to anything. Jonathan, desperately in need of some good news, has faced harsh criticism over his slow response to the girls\u2019 abduction. His supporters accuse the #BringBackOurGirls campaign of being opposition stooges, using the girls\u2019 fate for political mileage. Hundreds more women and girls have been abducted by Boko Haram in recent years \u2013 and dozens of schoolboys and teachers were killed by the group that opposes secular education and other aspects of Western culture. But the mass kidnapping in April and the BringBackOurGirls hashtag coined by Nigerian activists attracted global attention to the schoolgirls\u2019 plight. The schoolgirls had gathered at a lightly guarded boarding school on the outskirts of the town of Chibok for their final exams when the attack happened. Gunmen loaded 276 girls into trucks and drove away. Parents and local officials accused Nigeria\u2019s military of failing to pursue and recover the girls. According to Nigerian officials, 57 escaped and 219 remain in custody. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau later released a video describing the girls as slaves and threatening to \u201csell them in the market.\u201d A video of the girls reciting the Koran and dressed in Islamic clothing was also released. Nigeria, a country of 170 million, is roughly divided between the north, which is predominantly Muslim, and the mostly Christian south. Boko Haram emerged over a decade ago in response to Nigeria\u2019s corrupt ruling class and opposes what it sees as the taint of Western influences such as taxation, democracy and automatic teller machines. It has become increasingly fragmented in recent years, with some factions opposed to the group\u2019s violent attacks on Muslims. Boko Haram\u2019s assaults initially focused on police stations and military posts. In recent years, the group has stepped up its violence, killing thousands of people in attacks on villages, churches, schools, markets, open-air video entertainment venues, bus stations and other crowded public places.", "label": "observing"}

Part of the deal includes \u201cthe need to rescue all the captives of the terrorists, including the students of Government Girls\u2019 Secondary School, Chibok\u201d, said Mike Omeri, anti-terrorism spokesman of the president\u2019s national information centre. There would also be an immediate ceasefire, with Boko Haram apparently saying it would suspend its bombing and kidnap campaign, and the Nigerian army agreeing not to target suspected militant camps. \u201cFrom the discussions, [Boko Haram\u2019s representatives] indicated their desire for, and willingness to discuss and resolve all associated issues,\u201d Mr Omeri said. \u201cThey also assured that the school girls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.\u201d The announcement came days after protesters marched in Abuja to mark the six-month anniversary of the girl\u2019s abduction. Close to 300 teenage girls were kidnapped by armed gunmen as they were driven back to their school in coaches after an excursion. Some managed to escape, but an estimated 219 are still being held captive, reportedly in Nigeria\u2019s neighbour, Cameroon, whose military was involved in the ceasefire talks. There was immediate scepticism, however. One Western diplomat in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s coastal commercial capital, pointed out that Goodluck Jonathan, the president, is in the middle of campaigning for the presidential elections due next year. \u201cHe\u2019s having a tough run with Boko Haram, and he needs a boost,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cIt\u2019s the main thing that people are concerned about, security. If he can score a ceasefire, great. If he can bring the girls back, even better. \u201cBut we\u2019ve not yet heard from Boko Haram. Until then, we\u2019re taking this with a little salt.\u201d Aid groups working to secure the release of the schoolgirls welcomed the news, but also remained cautious. \u201cThis ceasefire is incredibly promising, but we aren\u2019t there yet,\u201d said Hussaini Abdu, country director for ActionAid Nigeria. \u201cUntil every girl is released negotiations must continue. \u201cWe are excited about the possibility of restoring peace in the country, but these girls must remain a priority and we therefore urge the government to ensure that the safety of all of them is guaranteed as part of any truce.\u201d Britain is among several nations that has offered assistance to the Nigerian government and its military to help find the missing schoolgirls. Privately, Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigerians\u2019 reactions to the kidnap crisis. The girls are understood to have been separated into several groups, making an armed rescue far more complicated and dangerous, leaving talks as the only likely route to their release. Boko Haram has in the past insisted that it would only release the teenagers if Nigeria freed several of the group\u2019s senior commanders, who have been captured and are in jail. There were no immediate details of what Boko Haram will get out of the ceasefire deal. The group has been blamed for hundreds of killings in bomb or gun attacks, and it is increasingly choosing targets over an ever wider area of northern Nigeria. It began as a local militia targeting people who broke strict Islamic regulations such as drinking alcohol. But it recently linked with al-Qaeda\u2019s franchise in West Africa, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and appears to have taken on far more ambitious aims, including ridding northern Nigeria of Christians. Boko Haram\u2019s leader, Abubakar Shekau, frequently justifies attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigeria\u2019s volatile \u201cMiddle Belt\u201d, where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet. The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls' return. Officials from the Geneva-based organisation sat in on talks between the Nigerian government and a senior Boko Haram leader that was being held in one of the country's maximum security prisons. The Red Cross officials also visited a number of other jails, identifying a list of 16 senior commanders that Boko Haram wants freed in exchange for the 219 hostages kidnapped from the north-east town of Chibok. The ICRC's role in the talks represented the first official confirmation that the Nigerian government was actively engaged in talks with Boko Haram. Publicly, Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, has previously maintained that the government would never agree to any kind of negotiations.", "label": "observing"}

Earlier, a group of insurgents attacked the Borno town of Sabon Gida, said one military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media. \"The fight was tough and it seems the insurgents wanted to destroy everything in Sabon Gida. They came around 5:00pm and by 6:00pm, the fight was over,\" added local trader Bilyaminu Aliyu. Boko Haram took over Damboa, which is about 50 miles southwest of the Borno state capital Maiduguri, in July, destroying much of the town and forcing thousands to flee. The group's leader Abubakar Shekau claimed that they left voluntarily but the military said they recaptured it in early August. Residents have since begun returning. Elsewhere, locals said that dozens of suspected Boko Haram gunmen had stormed the town of Abadam, north of Maiduguri near Lake Chad, on Thursday, before the supposed ceasefire. A number of residents said at least 30 people were killed on Thursday and Friday \u2013 after the purported deal \u2013 while hundreds of others were forced to flee across the border into neighbouring Niger. \"We all heard of the ceasefire over the radio but it seems the insurgents are not perturbed at all,\" another resident, Mallam Babagana, said on Sunday. \"To me, they (the militants) don't even care about it because they increased their attacks from Friday, the very day the ceasefire was announced. By Saturday, they hoisted their flags.\" Meanwhile, Enoch Mark, whose daughter and niece are among the 219 schoolgirls who have been held by Boko Haram since mid-April, said there had been another attack in neighbouring Adamawa state. He said the attack, in the village of Wagga on Saturday, saw some 40 women abducted \u2013 an established Boko Haram tactic in its bloody five-year insurgency. On Friday, eight people were also killed on a road in the Borno state village of Shaffa near where a prominent Muslim leader, the Emir of Gwoza, was ambushed and killed by Boko Haram fighters in May. Mr Babagana said local hunters on their way to recover the bodies of the eight fought battles with militants on Saturday in Azul, also in the Hawul local government area. \"The unrelenting terrorists waylaid our members at around 9:00am and serious fighting ensued,\" said Mr Babagana, who heads a local vigilante group. \"We lost four of our members and we killed three terrorists.\" Independent corroboration of attacks in the remote northeast are almost impossible, with communications devastated by the violence and access fraught with danger. The police and the military have largely stopped communicating on attacks. Edited by Steve Wilson", "label": "against"}

A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militants six months ago, and talks were due to continue in neighbouring Chad on Monday. Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least six attacks over the weekend \u2013 blamed by security sources on the insurgents \u2013 that have killed several dozen people since the announcement of the ceasefire. A government spokesman has said that the fighting on Sunday may be the work of criminal gangs in the lawless region. An army officer, who requested anonymity, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but soldiers fought them off. \u201cOur men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,\u201d the officer said. He said an armoured vehicle and some arms were recovered from the insurgents. Damboa, a garrison town near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive. A member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, \u201cTwo of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.\u201d Separately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa. Tada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain. \u201cMy brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,\u201d he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone. \u201cThey [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain.

Apart from one appearance on a Boko Haram video, the girls have not been seen since the brazen nighttime raid on the town near the Cameroon border, although police and a parent said last month that one of the victims had been released.

A senior Nigerian security source confirmed the existence of talks, but said it remained unclear whether Abuja was negotiating with self-proclaimed movement leader Abubakar Shekau, or another faction within the group. \u201cCommitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously,\u201d the security source told Reuters. Several rounds of negotiations have been attempted in recent years but they have never achieved a peace deal, partly because the group is believed to be deeply divided. \u201cThere are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group.

The announcement came in a video sent to Agence France-Presse on Saturday in which the militant group\u2019s leader, Abubakar Shekau, ruled out future talks with the government and said the girls had converted to Islam and been married off since being kidnapped more than six months ago. Some 276 schoolgirls were seized from the remote north-eastern town of Chibok in Borno state in April. Many escaped in the first couple of days but 219 remain missing. More than 500 women and girls aged from infancy to 65 have been kidnapped by Boko Haram and held in militant camps since 2009, Human Rights Watch said this week, including 60 reportedly kidnapped from two towns in north-eastern Nigeria last week. Many have been targeted because they are Christians or attending school. Girls and women abducted by the Islamist group and later released have spoken of life in captivity that included forced marriage and labour, rape, torture, psychological abuse and coerced religious conversion. Shekau said in the latest video that all of the Chibok schoolgirls had become Muslims. \u201cThey have now memorised two chapters of the Qur\u2019an,\u201d he said.

Pogo Bitrus, the head of the Chibok Elders Forum, said: \u201cWe were sceptical about the talks to release our girls and we never took the ceasefire seriously because since the announcement, they have never stopped attacking communities.

The deal would mark a huge breakthrough after a five-year insurgency by extremists seeking to create an Islamic state in the north of Africa\u2019s most populous country. It has left thousands dead and a worldwide outcry was prompted when the girls were abducted in April from the north-eastern town of Chibok. Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign tweeted: \u201cWe are monitoring the news with huge expectations.\u201d But questions surrounded the purported agreement on Friday. Similar claims from the government and military have failed to bear fruit. The Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, is expected to declare that he is standing for re-election, and positive news about the hostages and insurgency could deflect criticism of his handling of the crisis. Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, told a press conference in the capital, Abuja: \u201cAlready, the terrorists have announced a ceasefire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a ceasefire.\u201d Omeri claimed that there had been direct negotiations this week about the release of the missing girls. Boko Haram negotiators \u201cassured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well\u201d, he said. The truce was announced on Friday by Nigeria\u2019s chief of defence staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, who ordered his troops to comply immediately with the agreement. Boko Haram has not made a public statement. The group had been demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls. Jonathan had said he could not countenance a prisoner swap. The failure of Jonathan\u2019s government to rescue the girls has prompted an international campaign and daily Bring Back Our Girls rallies in Abuja to highlight the girls\u2019 plight. There was further anger when posters calling for Jonathan\u2019s re-election in February by using the hashtag BringBackGoodluck2015 appeared until he ordered them to be torn down. In July, Jonathan met for the first time parents of the girls and dozens of classmates who managed to escape. It followed months of controversy in which the parents had sought a meeting. He finally agreed to the meeting after a request from Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by Taliban militants in 2012 and won the Nobel peace prize this month for her campaigning for girls\u2019 right to an education. Jonathan\u2019s principal secretary, Hassan Tukur, told Agence France-Presse on Friday that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as a deal to release the 219 girls. Tukur said he had represented the government at two meetings with the Islamist extremists in neighbouring Chad, mediated by that country\u2019s president, Idriss D\u00e9by. \u201cBoko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,\u201d said Tukur. \u201cThey have agreed to release the Chibok girls,\u201d he added. But there was uncertainty about the identity of Boko Haram\u2019s representative at the talks, named by Tukur as Danladi Ahmadu. Multiple analysts cast doubt on Ahmadu\u2019s credibility as a Boko Haram envoy. Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government, told AFP: \u201cI have never heard of such a man, and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire, it would come from the group\u2019s leader, Abubakar Shekau.\u201d Ralph Bello-Fadile, an assistant to Nigeria\u2019s national security adviser (NSA), told a conference on Monday that it had been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau. \u201cGovernment wants to negotiate, but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau,\u201d he told a Chatham House event in Abuja. Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday yesterday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group\u2019s chief security officer and in charge of publicity. He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau. He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means \u201cwestern education is forbidden\u201d. The name was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders \u2013 the insurgents themselves never use the term. Their leaders have exclusively used the name Jama\u2019atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda\u2019awati wal-Jihad, which means \u201cPeople Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet\u2019s Teachings and Jihad\u201d. Boko Haram stormed the school in Chibok in April and snatched nearly 300 students, of whom 219 remain in captivity.

In a new video message, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau says the schoolgirls have converted to Islam and married off. \"The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,\" he says, laughing. The news goes counter to what the Nigerian government said nearly two weeks ago when it announced a cease-fire deal with the terrorist organization, raising hopes among the families of the kidnapped girls \u2014 who were taken from the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok in April \u2014 that their daughters would soon be released. But as the weeks dragged on with no sign of the kidnapped girls, hopes began to fade. \"I was very excited when I heard the news \u2014 I will finally reunite with my daughter,\" said Hamidah Amira, 36, whose 17-year-old daughter was kidnapped. But then desperation set in, especially as Boko Haram abducted dozens of young women and teenagers in northeast Nigeria and continued to launch attacks that forced hundreds to flee. Despite those incidents, the government insisted negotiations with the Islamists were ongoing in Chad, as some began to raise doubts a cease-fire was even agreed upon by the group. Martin Ewi, senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies' office in Pretoria, said he didn't think Boko Haram had agreed to a truce, citing the lack of public statements on the issue in the past two weeks. \"The government might be talking to one faction \u2026 and then you have the other factions which might not have bought into the idea of dialogue,\" he said. Human Rights Watch estimates Boko Haram, whose name loosely translates as \"Western education is forbidden,\" has abducted around 500 young women over the past five years. Although some girls managed to escape from the Islamists, the whereabouts and the fate of the rest of the young women are uncertain. A recent Human Rights Watch report, based on interviews with victims and witnesses of Boko Haram abductions, offers rare insight into a series of physical and sexual abuses the girls suffer in captivity, including rape, forced labor and beating. \"We found that the Nigerian government has never interviewed these girls, never really found out or learned what they've gone through, never attempted to do any kind of investigations,\" said Rona Peligal, Human Rights Watch deputy director for the Africa Division. \"They were kind of left on their own.\" Chibok resident Solomon Ali is deeply critical of the government's handling of the situation since the beginning. \"We were disappointed that the government has done nothing to ensure these girls are released,\" he said, adding officials have failed to keep the community informed. Outraged by the kidnappings and the atrocities committed by Boko Haram, the international community has urged the Nigerian government to step up its efforts to free the girls. Since April, a campaign under the motto \"Bring Back Our Girls\" went viral on social media. Peligal says Nigerian authorities should do a better job responding to the Boko Haram threat and ensuring protection around schools. \"The government needs to better anticipate and plan for those kinds of abductions because they're continuing,\" she said. \"And the government should respond capably.\" Ewi worries the girls would not be freed unless the government yields to Boko Haram's demands to release some of their militants. \"You can't pursue military operations and still be hoping to release the girls alive,\" he said. Analysts warn the situation is likely to get worse in the months ahead of the 2015 election. Earlier this week, President Goodluck Jonathan, who is under increasing scrutiny for his failure to locate the girls, confirmed he would be running for re-election. \"The Boko Haram issue has been indeed politicized, and I expect it would be further politicized as we get closer to the election,\" said Peligal. In the meantime, Amira \u2014 like other moms \u2014 waits, while making a personal appeal to Boko Haram to release her daughter and the other girls. \"They should sympathize with us, not with the government,\" Amira said.

Bedeh claimed the truce, which was widely welcomed, would lay the groundwork for the release of the more than 200 girls who were abducted in April, spurring the explosion of the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. On Saturday, the supposedly appeased group launched an attack on a town in Adamawa State in eastern Nigeria, capturing 40 women and planting a flag in the town of Wagga. They also beheaded six victims during an assault on Friday, after the ceasefire deal was announced. All of which makes a truce, supposedly negotiated with the \u201cchief of security\u201d of the Boko Haram group and the Nigerian government, seem decidedly shaky. The ceasefire claims, and Boko Haram\u2019s subsequent actions, have left people in Nigeria scratching their heads, with experts saying the ceasefire may have been a mirage, either a fraud concocted by the government or the middleman who brokered the agreement, whose real-life links to Boko Haram are now in dispute. Alleged Boko Haram envoy Danladi Ahmadu is now under scrutiny, with many questioning whether he is in fact the group\u2019s chief of security and has the authority to speak on its behalf. During an interview on Friday, Ahmadu didn\u2019t explicitly say that Boko Haram had agreed to a ceasefire, and he did not give details of the girls\u2019 release, Arab News reports. Elders in Borno state in Nigeria\u2019s north-east have publicly said that they believe the government was negotiating with a fraudster, and have yet to talk to the real Boko Haram. Boko Haram, meanwhile, has not released a public statement about the ceasefire. Rather, they have continued on a weekend campaign of violence, holding running battles with Nigerian security forces, who say that they have yet to receive any word from their superiors ordering them to cease fire in skirmished with the insurgents. \u201cIt is not clear who the said Boko Haram negotiator is, and whether he has the mandate of the entire group or just a faction of the entire group,\u201d Arab News quoted Nnamdi Obasi, senior analyst of Nigeria for Crisis Group, an independent, nongovernmental organization.

According to the announcement, more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls who were abducted this year will be freed. According to CNN, the details of the release are expected to be negotiated next week. In August, the militant group Boko Haram declared an \"Islamic state\" in northeastern Nigeria, a territory largely occupied by the fighters. Boko Haram is believed to be hiding the girls somewhere in this area. This week marked six months since the mass kidnapping took place. Here's what has happened since. On April 14, 276 Nigerian girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants from a school in Chibok, northern Nigeria, according to official figures. The mass abduction occurred at night, and it took days before the full scale of the kidnapping became clear. Shortly after the abductions, a military spokesperson claimed that most of the girls had been rescued by Nigerian soldiers, but the remarks turned out to be wrong. Whether or not the Nigerian army is suited to finding the girls has been questioned: Its reputation in the rural north is bad, and it is often accused of lacking transparency and its soldiers of committing crimes. One recent video allegedly showed Nigerian soldiers slitting prisoners' throats, according to Amnesty International. In the weeks following the mass kidnapping, criticism of the Nigerian government and the military had quickly grown as they failed to free the girls. In May, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau released a video message claiming that the girls would \"remain slaves with us.\" Nearly 200 days have passed since the girls were abducted, and according to estimates, more than 200 schoolgirls are still being held by Boko Haram militants. Only a few dozen girls have managed to escape over the past months: The Times of London cited an example of four girls who were able to flee from their captors and walked for three weeks through the jungle. Most of the escapes, however, took place shortly after the abductions, as this graph shows. As time passed, hope faded for many parents, and reports of escapes became less frequent. \"The longer they're there, the greater likelihood they become dispersed, and the more difficult they are to track down,\" Jennifer Cook, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Time magazine this week, before the reports emerged that Boko Haram was considering freeing them. There are conflicting numbers of how many girls are still in captivity \u2014 some say 215, some say 219. The numbers used in our graph only refer to the mass kidnapping in April. Other abductions of women and girls have occurred since. Boko Haram is predominantly active in the northeast of Nigeria, where the girls were kidnapped, but its sphere of influence extends further into the west and south of the country. The militants have conducted an increasing number of attacks over the past few months and are now believed to be active in an area which could be up to 500,000 square kilometers, or 193,000 square miles. Its core area spreads over as much as 250,000 square kilometers, roughly the size of the United Kingdom. However, Boko Haram is not in full control of most of the areas in which it is active. Fatalities from non-criminal Nigerian violence \u2014 a term that includes attacks by terror groups and communal or political actors \u2014 have risen rapidly since 2010, and Boko Haram attacks are the main driver behind this rise. The militant group has killed at least 5,100 Nigerians this year, according to estimates of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. This graph shows how fatalities caused by Boko Haram went up from around zero to more than 5,000 annually within only six years. Although the threat posed by Boko Haram had grown steadily, it took until the April abductions for the conflict to make international headlines. The burst of reporting was accompanied by a huge rise in attention to Boko Haram on social media. Up until May 13, about 3.3 million tweets were posted, using the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. According to the BBC, most people who used the hashtag lived in Nigeria (27 percent) and the United States (26 percent). Still, thousands of tweets are being posted each week in an effort to raise awareness about the fate of the Nigerian schoolgirls. The social media campaign found prominent supporters: As of Oct. 17, more than 57,000 users had retweeted Michelle Obama's message: \"Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families. It's time to #BringBackOurGirls.\" Our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families. It's time to #BringBackOurGirls. -mo pic.twitter.com/glDKDotJRt \u2014 The First Lady (@FLOTUS) May 7, 2014 The Obama administration deployed 80 U.S. military personnel to Chad in May. In a letter, the White House said: \"These personnel will support the operation of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft for missions over northern Nigeria and the surrounding area,\" and aid in the search for the missing schoolgirls. Chad is east of Nigeria. Other countries, such as China, France and Britain, have also sent military assistance to the region. According to some reports, Boko Haram started to sell some of the kidnapped girls as brides to militants in May. The value of a girl, according to Boko Haram: $12. The Associated Press cited reports of forced mass weddings which had taken place after the abductions. In a video message, Boko Haram leader Shekau had reportedly announced: \"I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah.\" The hunt for Boko Haram leader Shekau had started well before the mass abductions of the girls. In 2013, the U.S. State Department added Shekau to its \"Rewards for Justice Program,\" offering up to $7 million for information that led to his capture. Those efforts have been unsuccessful. A video which was released this month showed Shekau alive and in freedom. Meanwhile, USAID \u2014 the international development agency of the United States \u2014 has devoted about $150 million to programs aimed at providing education to Nigerian children and teenagers. The programs primarily target internally displaced children and others who are affected by the violence in Nigeria. Only 28 percent of primary-age children have ever attended school in Borno, the state in which the kidnappings took place. The low attendance rates in an area partially under the sphere of influence of Boko Haram does not seem to be a coincidence. Boko Haram's name can be translated as \"Western education is sin.\"", "label": "observing"}

It will be especially rich in toxic waste from the local petroleum and medical industries. \u201cWe wanted to do something to honor the president,\u201d says Republican State Senator Doug Perlman, who was the lead sponsor of the bill. \u201cAnd I think a pile of garbage is a fitting tribute to Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cWe originally planned on naming it after a nearby mountain. But then someone jokingly suggested we name it after Obama. I never thought and idea like that would actually pass. But I was pleasantly surprised.\u201d The president is hardly popular in North Dakota. The most recent poll in December 2013 found that Obama has a 35% approval rating in the state, although that figure may have fallen further in the year since. Yet even considering the political climate, seasoned observers are surprised that two Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cI supported Obama because I thought he would end the wars in the Middle East;\u201d says Allison Mitchell, a progressive Democrat from Grand Forks. \u201cBut he decided to fight new wars abroad instead of fighting for single-payer health care and jobs here at home. \u201cI guess people expected me to oppose this landfill thing because I\u2019m a Democrat. But honestly I don\u2019t really care anymore. Maybe this small act of protest will wake him up.\u201d Ordinary citizens in the state also seem to approve of the government\u2019s choice. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better name,\u201d says Joe Blough, a plumber from Minot. \u201cIt\u2019s darkly colored and it's full of shit. That pretty much sums up Obama.\u201d", "label": "for"}

In a lengthy press conference Thursday afternoon, RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson also said Michael Zehaf Bibeau shot Cpl. Nathan Cirillo from behind, and the soldier did not see him coming. Zehaf Bibeau shot at a second soldier with Cpl. Cirillo, but missed. Police say the video shows Zehaf Bibeau was able to get from Wellington Street to Centre Block in about one minute and 20 seconds and there was little time to respond. The video shows Mounties chasing him, closely behind. The video does not show what occurred inside Parliament, where Zehaf Bibeau was killed. Police said they are still putting together what happened inside.

Paulson said there is no known link between Zehaf Bibeau and Martin Couture-Rouleau, who ran down two Canadian soldiers in Quebec Monday, killing one. However, Zehaf Bibeau was associated with \u201can individual known to us,\u201d Paulson said.

(Under that charge the man was charged and convicted under the name Michael Bibeau-Zehaf.) His most serious conviction came on Dec. 7, 2004, when Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau pleaded guilty to possession of phencyclidine, also known as PCP, and was sentenced to a 60-day prison term. On the same day, he also pleaded guilty to marijuana possession and was sentenced to one day in prison. He has also been convicted for failing to comply with conditions of a release.

On Tuesday, the RCMP confirmed that Martin Rouleau, the man accused of running over two Canadian Forces soldiers in Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, had been one of 90 suspects under similar observation.

Witnesses say they saw Bibeau wearing a black coat with blue jeans, according to the CBC. The same report says gun used in the attack was a double-barrel shotgun. Although, if the example of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu terrorist suspect Martin Rouleau is any indication, he may have changed his name following his conversion to Islam. Before he allegedly ran over two Canadian soldiers in the parking lot of a Service Canada location, Mr. Rouleau reportedly changed his name to Ahmad LeConverti (Ahmad The Converted).

A terrorist struck at the heart of the nation Wednesday, gunning down a sentry at the National War Memorial and wreaking havoc on Parliament Hill where the marble and stone halls echoed with gunfire and ran with blood. The gunman was shot and killed near the Library of Parliament, reportedly by House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, a former RCMP officer, and the man responsible for security on the Hill. It appears the gunman walked right past the Centre Block\u2019s Reading Room, where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was meeting with his caucus Wednesday morning. Citing U.S. intelligence sources, CBS identified the attacker as Canadian-born Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32. That had not been independently confirmed. The fatal showdown in Centre Block followed the cold-blooded slaying of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo standing guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a short distance away from Parliament Hill. That soldier, a reservist with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada, based in Hamilton, was shot at close range in front of the war memorial at 9:52 a.m. He was rushed to the Ottawa Hospital\u2019s Civic Campus, but did not survive his injuries. It was unclear whether the gunman was acting alone or was joined in his attack by others, but after the attack, the gunman fled toward Parliament Hill, according to witness accounts. Parliament Hill and large swaths of downtown Ottawa went into lockdown as Ottawa police, the RCMP and special forces pursued confusing and unconfirmed reports of gunshots near the Rideau Centre and the Chateau Laurier. At one point, officials believed at least three gunmen could be involved. It was still unclear by late afternoon Wednesday just how many people took part in the attack, but police said there had been no shooting near the downtown mall after all. City Hall, the Ottawa courthouse, Lisgar Collegiate and the University of Ottawa were among the many institutions that went into emergency lockdown. The NHL postponed an Ottawa Senators game scheduled for Wednesday night, and the National Arts Centre cancelled two performances. Inside Parliament Hill, a gunman \u2014 likely the same one who shot the National War Memorial sentry \u2014 stormed into Centre Block where the NDP and Conservative caucuses had convened for 9:15 a.m. meetings. The Liberal caucus was meeting in the basement. Prime Minister Stephen Harper was with his party\u2019s caucus when the gunman entered the second floor of Centre Block, but was escorted to safety by his RCMP security team. Across the hall, in the NDP caucus room, about 100 MPs and aides piled tables and chairs in front of the doors after they heard gunshots crash through Centre Block just after 10 a.m. \u201cA series of gunshots rang out and we realized they were right on the other side of the door,\u201d NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Citizen. Parliament Hill security officers rushed politicians out of the building, Liberal MP Marc Garneau among them. \u201cYou could smell the gunpowder,\u201d he said. Security officers pursued the gunman in the Hall of Honour, near the Library of Parliament, and exchanged a hail of gunfire. One guard was wounded in the confrontation that killed the terrorist. It\u2019s believed Vickers fired the shots that killed him. A video shot by Globe and Mail reporter Josh Wingrove showed crouching RCMP officers moving through the main hall toward the Parliamentary library, as the hallway echoed with gunfire.  \u201cI am safe and profoundly grateful to Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe,\u201d Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino said on Twitter. Justice Minister Peter MacKay offered similar praise: \u201cThank God for Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers and our Canadian security forces.\u201d The injured guard was taken to The Ottawa Hospital with a non-life threatening leg injury. The Ottawa Hospital also treated two other people injured in the incident. The attack was the most serious security breach of Parliament Hill since 1966, when an unhinged man, Paul Chartier, tried to blow up 10 sticks of dynamite on the floor of the House of Commons. He killed only himself when the explosives detonated before he could throw them. Wednesday\u2019s shooting at the National War Memorial represents the second time this week that a Canadian soldier has come under attack on national soil. On Monday, 25-year-old Martin Rouleau, of Saint-Jean-sur-Richeleau, southeast of Montreal, used his car to assault two Canadian soldiers, one of whom later died of his wounds. Rouleau was a convert to Islam whose online postings had become so radical that the RCMP confiscated his passport. The attacks could be a reaction from homegrown extremists to the federal government\u2019s decision to join the international coalition battling the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in the Middle East. Parliament approved a motion to launch a combat mission against ISIL earlier this month. \u201cCanada will not be terrorized or intimidated,\u201d senior Conservative cabinet minister Jason Kenney declared in a Twitter message. Wednesday\u2019s attack began on the ground of the National War Memorial, dedicated to all of those who have fought and died for this country. Witnesses said the long-haired gunman, dressed in a dark hoodie, blue jeans and wrapped in a scarf, opened fire on one of the two guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The gunman used a long rifle of some kind, possibly a shotgun. Construction worker Matthew Blais was working near the East Block when he heard what he described as a bunch of \u201cpops.\u201d \u201cI looked over at the War Memorial and I saw a man with a rifle shooting at innocent people,\u201d Blais said. \u201cWe ducked for cover.\u201d Raivo Nommik, a lighting designer, was walking past the National War Memorial when the shots were fired: \u201c(The soldier) was shot at close range: It couldn\u2019t have been more than 20 feet.\u201d Tourist Jan Lugtenborg, of the Netherlands, said he was waiting near the memorial for a tour bus. \u201cThen all of a sudden this happens: I heard four shots. I thought it was a firework,\u201d he said. Lugtenborg said he saw a man with long, black hair running with a rifle. \u201cWe were scared like hell so we ran back,\u201d he said. Chaos ensued. Witnesses don\u2019t agree on what happened next. Some said the gunman ran toward Parliament Hill. Others said he carjacked a vehicle first. Blais said he saw the man jump into a green car. \u201cHe parked right in front of Parliament and ran into the building,\u201d he said. Another witness, Construction worker Scott Walsh, was working near the East Block when he saw a man run on to Parliament Hill, carjack a vehicle from a man in a dark suit, and drive it to the Centre Block. The NDP\u2019s Angus described the wild scene inside the party\u2019s caucus room after the first shots were fired on the Hill. \u201cWe put up these flimsy little tables to get people behind and get them under chairs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that everyone was safe. Security came in fairly fast \u2014 I was surprised how fast they came \u2014 and I could see from the look in their eyes that they were very worried. We know them. We talk to them every day.

One gunman was killed, and police said they were hunting for as many as two others. The bloodshed immediately raised the specter of a coordinated terrorist attack, with Canada already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run earlier in the week against two Canadian soldiers by a man who police say was fired up with radical Muslim fervor. Witnesses said the soldier was gunned down at point-blank range by a man carrying a rifle and dressed all in black, with a scarf over his face.

Actress and singer Raven-Symone, who rose to fame with Cosby in the hit television sitcom \"The Cosby Show\", revealed to the TMZ offices that she too had been raped and drugged years ago following the shows last episode. There are whispers that Cosby wouldn't allow Raven-Symone in the production of the last season of his show, but abruptly changed his mind. It was never revealed what changed his original intentions.

Lawyer John Schmitt said the fact that the allegations are being repeated \u201cdoes not make them true.\u201d But this particular accusation is interesting. We have a very successful star in Raven-Symone who doesn't look to need any press or financial reward. Which makes us think that Cosby has a really shady past. Cosby went silent when asked about the new allegations in an interview on NPR on Saturday In the interview, reporter Scott Simon asked Cosby about the claims, but the legendary comic just silently shook his head. To emphasize Cosby\u2019s silence, Simon said, \u201cYou\u2019re shaking your head no.\u201d Cosby has never been criminally charged with sexual assault, but he did settle a civil case in 2006 brought by Temple University employee Andrea Constand who claimed he drugged and groped her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion. Differences between the two were \"resolved to the mutual satisfaction\" of both Cosby and Constand, according to a new statement issued Monday by their lawyers. The media has since found some interesting clips from Cosby's past. Now, the Village Voice unearthed audio clips from the comedian\u2019s ninth comedy album, \u201cIt\u2019s True! It\u2019s True,\u201d which was released in 1969. An unfortunately titled compilation given the current headlines, the album includes a disturbing track of Cosby describing his long-standing desire to drug women and take advantage of them. In the routine, Cosby describes his childhood fascination with a drug, \u201cSpanish fly,\u201d that supposedly makes women go crazy (or renders them incapacitated) if slipped into a drink. He says his fascination continued into adulthood, when he and \u201cI Spy\u201d co-star Robert Culp had the opportunity to go to Spain \u2014 and he became hopeful he might finally get his hands on some Spanish fly. Cosby describes how Culp, too, wanted to get his hands on the drug.

As difficult as it is to imagine the vibrant-coloured-sweater wearing father figure -- who made us laugh through childhood all the way into adulthood -- could be a serial rapist, it is hard to ignore the latest accuser, Raven Symone who stole everyone's heart as little Olivia Kendall in \"The Cosby Show\". According to Hip-Hop Hangover, former child actor Symone told TMZ officials that she too had been drugged and raped by Cosby following the wrapping up of \"The Cosby Show\". The site claims that there were even rumours about Cosby disallowing Symone from appearing in the last season of the show initially and later abruptly changing his mind. According to a statement from her lawyer, \"...we among so many others are tired of the media worshipping and praising a man that has a past so terrible that it is unbelievable.

And what we thought was a mistake or anomaly has surfaced to become a lifestyle. We will be pursuing damages that are not going to be disclosed at this time.\"  Bill Cosby with kids who appeared on \"The Cosby Show\". Cosby has been accused of rape by Raven Symone, who was a child star in the popular TV show.Reuters Symone's allegations strengthen the accusations of various other women including music industry publicist and journalist Joan Tarshis, actress Barbara Bowman and 15 others. In one of the most revealing interviews, Tarshis told CNN that when she was just 19 years old, Cosby took her to his bungalow and gave her a drink, shortly after which she passed out. The next thing she remembers is him removing her underwear, she revealed. She went on to explain she used to \"idolise\" Cosby at the time and no one would have believed her anyway, which is why she refrained from coming out with the truth then. \"I assumed I was not the only girl that he was doing this with, but who's going to believe me? Bill Cosby, the all-American dad, the all-American husband, Mr Jell-O, the guy everybody loves. Who would believe me? They would probably think I was out to get something,\" Tarshis said.  Bowman, who also gave an all-revealing interview of her experiences with Cosby told CNN that she was thrilled at having him mentor her; a position he misused. One night while at his apartment, she passed out although she only had a single glass of wine. Her next memory is of doubling over a toilet bowl in her underwear and a men's t-shirt, as Cosby held her hair back. She went on to add that throughout their working relationship the drug-facilitated rapes continued. In an article for The Washington Post Bowman wrote, \"as a teenager, I tried to convince myself I had imagined it. I even tried to rationalize it: Bill Cosby was going to make me a star and this was part of the deal.\" During their last sexual encounter, Bowman says she tried to wrestle from his grasp, \"until he eventually gave up, angrily called me 'a baby' and sent me home to Denver.\"  Meanwhile \"The View\" co-host Whoopie Goldberg expressed doubts over Bowman's accusations and invited her to come on the program and answer a few questions directly. \"Quite honestly, you know, look, I'm sorry, having been on both sides of this where people allege that you do something, it doesn't matter now... I have a lot of questions for the lady. Maybe she'll come on,\" Goldberg said. Many women have alleged rape against Cosby since mid 2000s, however it was a 2-minute routine performed by comedian Hannibal Burress that brought it back to limelight. He said, \"Yeah, but you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches,\" Buress said. \"I've done this bit on stage and people think I'm making it up.... when you leave here, Google 'Bill Cosby rape.' That sh** has more results than 'Hannibal Buress'\". While Cosby still remains silent on the rape accusations against him, a 1969 stand-up routine, ironically titled \"It's True! It's True!\" has him explaining how as a kid he had heard about a wonder drug -- \"Spanish Fly\" -- that would make a girl go crazy once it was put into her drink. He then goes on to speak of his interest in such a drug, which could have been a prelude to Cosby living his fantasy of stripping women of their ability to say \"no\".", "label": "for"}

Samsung used to manufacture chips for the iPhone or iPad, but it was replaced by TSMC.

The smaller the manufacturing process, the smaller the chips and the less energy they consume. The rumor is that Apple has ordered 3,000 to 4,000 12-inch wafers monthly. Each wafer can supply several hundred processors. One question that remains is why Apple would choose a Samsung chip built using a 28-nanometer process over a smaller, more efficient 20-nanometer chip from TSMC.

Scroll down for video One man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm The Chinese man had seen his doctor complaining of stomach ache and itchy skin. Scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm parasites after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish Humans contract tapeworm infections from sushi by eating raw fish that has been infected with the worm in its larvae stage. When fish eat tapeworm eggs, the hatching larvae attach themselves to the intestinal wall of the fish and the worms infect the fish flesh. Because sushi is not cooked, the larvae can in turn transfer into the flesh of any human that eats the fish. Once a human is infected, a tapeworm will grow inside the intestine to a length of up to 15metres over a period of weeks. It can survive for years and go undetected for weeks or months, in turn releasing its own eggs that infect other parts of the human body. Symptoms include fatigue, constipation and abdominal discomfort - which can be so mild the victim may not notice anything is wrong. If larvae begin to migrate to other parts of the body they can start to eat away at the liver, eyes, heart or brain and cause life-threatening conditions. Doctors believe some of the uncooked Japanese delicacy of raw meat or fish must have become contaminated. He was treated at the Guangzhou No. 8 People's Hospital in Guangdong Province, in eastern China. Research has shown that eating raw or undercooked fish can lead to a variety of parasitic infections. Tapeworm infections occur after ingesting the larvae of diphyllobothrium, found in freshwater fish such as salmon, although marinated and smoked fish can also transmit the worm. While cases have increased in poorer areas due to improved sanitation, cases have increased in more developed countries,. This is most likely due to the soaring popularity of sushi, say doctors writing in the journal Canadian Family Physician. Study author Nancy Craig wrote: 'The widespread popularity of Japanese sushi and sashimi (slices of raw fish) is a contributor. 'But other popular dishes might also be implicated, such as raw salted or marinated fillets - which originate from Baltic and Scandinavian countries - carpaccio - very thin slices of raw fish common in Italy, raw salmon and ceviche - lightly marinated fish.' Dr Yin, of Guangzhou No. 8 People\u2019s Hospital, told the website that'smags.com that eating uncooked food contaminated with tapeworms' eggs could eventually cause cysticercosis, when the adult worms enters a person\u2019s blood stream. This type of infection is life-threatening once it reaches the brain.

Opposing Views reports that women who have eyes \u201cwith a nice shape and makeup\u201d could be deemed too tempting to other men, and police can make them wear veils. Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice announced this decision a few days ago. It\u2019s one bound to get universal criticism. Assyrian International News Agency covered what the Saudi Arabian committee\u2019s spokesman has to say about the new law. Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, explains that Saudi police \u201chave a right\u201d to make a woman cover her eyes. \u201cThe men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones. We have the right to do so.\u201d This development has sparked the question of what defines \u201ctempting eyes\u201d and how will women be evaluated on having them? An unidentified journalist in the nation best describes what Saudi police are going after. \u201cUncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble.\u201d He adds that a lot of people in Saudi Arabia will be very upset about the law.

Old news - from 2011 Does this sound fishy? It's weird. In fact, namely, the full text of the news agency Ainas article copied outright, from a post on the site the Daily Beast - published on 19 November 2011. Even then, in 2011, circulated the news of the Saudi law widely, and published, among other things, the British Daily Mail . The original source of the time seems to have been an article on the site bikyamasr.com. There are today a weird Russian blog titled \"Business World\", but through service Internet Archive can the old article from November 16, 2011 read. The text sets out no earlier source. So it is a three year old news now circulating as new. This results in multiple abnormalities. Under the text \"Prince Naif supports the new law\" links such as Omni to an article published this week on the site firsttoknow.com, alleging that \"Prince Naif, the Saudi throne appears to be an equally cruel ruler like his father King Abdullah, has spoken out in full support for the new law. \" But that claim is not particularly new, but comes from the publications that were made in 2011 - Prince Naif, or Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud as his real name was, namely, died in 2012. \"Religious police deny\" Abdulhadi Khalaf is a lecturer in Sociology at Lund University and expert on the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, and he says he has not heard about this news myself. Later he emailed a link. - It is evident that the \"religious police\" has denied that it has issued such a law, writes Khalaf. The religious police who Khalaf refers to the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of cargo (CPVPV), the Saudi authorities who declare that Sharia law is followed. Basically all the articles written about the law, as well in 2014 as in 2011, citing a Motlab Sheikh al Nabet to be a spokesperson for CPVPV. But Sheikh Motlab al Nabet exists nowhere on the web, in addition to the items on this particular law. And the link that Abdulhadi Khalaf find goes to an article that is published on the Saudi news website Hail News that Abdulhadi Khalaf says is credible \"information relating to the Saudi authorities.\" There CPVPV denies the story of the illegal tempting eyes. The article writes Hail News that \"the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of cargo say they are not issuing any statement which is consistent with yesterday's international spread accusations that they'd begun to crack down on women with glamorous eyes.\" Viral examiner fails to reach the Saudi Embassy in Stockholm, the Swedish embassy in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, claims not to have heard of the law. - Swedish Embassy in Rijad had no knowledge of it, says the Foreign Ministry's press service to Viral Browser.", "label": "against"}

Many people will oppose this in the country. They won't be silent.\" While in most Western nations there is harsh divide between Church and State, in Saudi Arabia no such segmentation exists. In March, King Abdullah awarded the committee more than $53 million to continue enforcing their religious dogma via the estimated 3,500 to 4,000 religious police officers, which patrol the streets.     As King Abdullah nears the end of his reign, there was hope that a younger and more liberal dictator would follow. Prince Naif was recently appointed as the heir to the throne, but after giving his support to the committee, there is little hope that Saudi Arabia will evolve in the human rights department. \"The committee is supported by all sides,\u201d Naif said. \u201cIt should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee.\" The parental \u201cbecause I told you so\u201d argument lacks logic and rationale, but such is the case when a nation resides under monarch rule. It remains unclear how many women will be found or charged with \"tempting eyes,\" but if there is a great enough dissenting voices, public outcry will hopefully have some bearing on the obscene policy.

Mr. Smith, the chief executive of the provocative news and entertainment group, spent $300,000 for a dinner at the Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio in Las Vegas during the International CES trade show in January, according to one person who was at the party and another one who knew about it. Mr. Smith, whose company closed financing last September that valued it at $2.5 billion, paid for the meal personally. More than 30 people were at the dinner, including friends, other Vice executives and staff members and directors like Tom Freston, a founder and former chief executive of MTV who later went on to run Viacom, according to a person who attended the event. Liquor flowed freely, with some bottles of wine costing more than $20,000, according to the people. The most expensive food item on the menu at the Prime Steakhouse, a Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant, is a 28-ounce bone-in rib eye for $85.  Shane Smith is the chief executive of Vice Media. FREDERICK M. BROWN / GETTY IMAGES To foot the bill, Mr. Smith dipped into his more than $1 million in winnings from gambling, especially at the blackjack table, during the week, the people said. News of the meal, which was first reported by Bloomberg, surfaced after executives at MGM Resorts International mentioned the outsize dinner bill during a company conference call on Tuesday. They cited it in response to a question from an analyst about how spending at the casino now compares with levels before the recession. MGM did not identify Mr. Smith as the guest who had hosted the dinner. James J. Murren, the chief executive of MGM, said he had not seen a check that size for several years. \u201cPeople are starting to spend money remarkably here,\u201d Mr. Murren said. The lavish dinner is the latest caper by Mr. Smith, who is charting a new course as a brash next-generation media mogul. He is known to drink with old-school media executives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the hipster enclave where Vice has its headquarters. He has called CNN an expletive and rented villas at Cannes during an annual international media conference there. \u201cThey live larger, and that is part of the Vice je ne sais quoi,\u201d said Michael E. Kassan, the chief executive of the media and marketing consulting firm MediaLink, who is known to throw his own prominent industry dinners. \u201cBut they do good stuff. I am a big fan. They represent so much of what is new and exciting in the world.\u201d Mr. Murren of MGM told the analyst Harry C. Curtis of Nomura Securities that he couldn\u2019t believe it when he first saw the tab. He said, \u201c$300,000 for dinner at Prime. That\u2019s a pretty good check.

Shane Smith is the CEO of Vice Media, the youth media company and digital content creation studio.  What\u2019s he buying? During a recent trip to Las Vegas, Smith paid $300,000 for dinner at the Bellagio casino\u2019s Prime Steakhouse. $300,000? On a steak? It wasn\u2019t just one steak. He paid the bill for the entire dinner party. According to Bloomberg, accounts vary on the exact number, but it\u2019s estimated that there were between 12 and 25 people at the dinner table. How much do these steaks cost? The Prime Steakhouse\u2019s most expensive steak \u2013 the 28oz bone-in rib eye \u2013 comes in at $85. They\u2019re unlikely to have made much of a dent in the price. The lion\u2019s share of the cost probably went on wine, which, the FT reports, cost $15,000 a bottle. The Las Vegas meal is not the only big spend from Mr Smith in recent times. According to Gawker, at Vice\u2019s 2014 Christmas party, Smith gave $1m to Vice employees as \u201cstocking stuffers\u201d. How does he afford all of this? On the night of the steak meal, Mr Smith had reportedly won $100,000 in a game of blackjack earlier in the evening. But even without that, he\u2019s not exactly short of cash. Vice has been growing in the last few years \u2013 receiving investments worth $500m last year alone ($250m each from Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks). Smith claims to be worth over $1bn. But in 2013, Forbes estimated that it was closer to $400m. It\u2019s still enough to keep him in steak and wine for the rest of his life though.

On Tuesday, MGM Resorts International Chairman Jim Murren cited the dinner bill as an \u201cencouraging sign\u201d that Las Vegas visitors were eager to spend money again.

The lavish meal at Bellagio\u2019s Prime Steakhouse took place during the Consumer Electronics Show. It included bottles of wine costing $15,000 each and was so expensive it merited a mention on the quarterly earnings call of MGM Resorts, the group which owns the Bellagio and other Las Vegas casino hotels.

Kerry Packer, the late Australian billionaire, was a regular in Las Vegas and was known to bet as much as $150,000 a hand. His visits to casinos often made the difference between gaming operators reporting profits or losses in their quarterly earnings. Mr Smith\u2019s identity as the buyer was first revealed by Bloomberg. He declined to comment on the meal. However, Vice Media is not lacking in confidence. The youth-focused company will go on a \u201cdeal spree\u201d in 2015 and explore an initial public offering if market conditions remain favourable, Mr Smith told the FT in December. The company has strengthened its senior management team with the appointment of James Schwab, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer, as co-president, who will help oversee a $500m \u201cwar chest\u201d for content, technology and distribution deals. \u201cVice will go on a deal spree in 2015,\u201d said Mr Smith. \u201cOur war chest is the size of the full valuation of our competition so we will see some major\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009deals happen.\u201d From the archive Vice eyes 2015 \u2018deal spree\u2019 and possible IPO The Vice Media Inc. application (app) is demonstrated on an Apple Inc. iPhone 5s for an arranged photograph in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Monday, Aug. 11, 2014.

Vice, which in 2013 also took a strategic stake from 21st Century Fox, wanted to stay independent, said Mr Smith. \u201cWe would be stupid not to think about an IPO.\u201d The company has recently been engaged in a war of words with Gawker, a rival site, which has in several stories accused Vice of underpaying its employees.

On a Tuesday earnings call, MGM Resorts International boasted that someone had recently spent $300,000 taking some acquaintances to dinner at one of its restaurants. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that it was Smith. The Vice co-founder spent the large sum of money at Bellagio's Prime Steakhouse when he was in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show last month, Bloomberg reported. Smith can certainly afford to pick up the tab after A+E Networks and Technology Crossover Ventures each invested $250 million in Vice for 10 percent stakes, on top of a $70 million investment from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox. Vice fashions itself a cutting-edge media company that eschews tradition and on occasion even courts danger. It made worldwide news when it took former NBA player Dennis Rodman and the Harlem Globetrotters to North Korea to hang out with Kim Jong Un. Smith has hinted at an IPO for Vice and guesses it could be worth $20 billion, likely an exaggeration, but an IPO of practically any magnitude would probably make him a billionaire. A Vice spokesman told The Hollywood Reporter that Smith won \"well north of\" $300,000 while playing blackjack during his trip to Las Vegas and it was the money from that windfall that funded the dinner. Still, the reveal of the $300,000 dinner might cause Smith some angst, given that he is being accused in some circles of living the good life while underpaying Vice staffers.  \"A company as successful as Vice should be paying decent wages. Vice doesn't,\" says a recent report from Gawker. \"The company pays shitty wages to low-level employees, compensating them instead with the sheer coolness of working for Vice Media.\" Then again, at a company party in December, Smith gave each full-time employee an envelope with $1,500 cash inside, amounting to a $1 million expenditure, according to insiders.

Fake Twitter fights. Fake DHL ads. Amazing viral video? Nope \u2014 a Jimmy Kimmel stunt! So, rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we\u2019re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn\u2019t share over the weekend. Ready? Here\u2019s what was fake on the Internet this week: 1. The Nobel Committee doesn\u2019t \u201cregret\u201d giving President Obama the Peace Prize. According to an invented \u201cnews release\u201d uploaded to Scribd by the prominent blogger and anti-war activist David Swanson, the Nobel Institute can\u2019t retract Obama\u2019s 2009 Peace Prize \u2014 but wishes it could. \u201cIt remains the obligation of the Committee to disassociate itself from actions taken by laureates that frustrate rather than advancing [sic] the fraternity between nations,\u201d the statement reads. (Pro-tip: International organizations rarely make glaring grammatical errors in major statements.) \u201cThe Committee therefore joins with the public statements of several Nobel Peace Laureates in expressing its regrets over the conduct of the 2009 prize recipient.\u201d The announcement has since been picked up by a number of right-wing outlets, including Before It\u2019s News. The only problem, of course: It isn\u2019t true. Dear Internet: The Nobel committee \u2033regrets\u201d giving Obama the 2009 peace prize story is bogus. I just spoke with the head of the institute 2. There is no-such thing as a \u201cpumpkin-spice-flavored condom.\u201d Though considering the social media response to the idea, some enterprising company may want to give it a try. A Photoshopped image of the \u201climited edition\u201d Durex condom circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook last week before a punny statement from Durex punctured the hoax: \u201cWe can\u2019t claim this one,\u201d the company said, \u201cbut we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.\u201d Har har. In unrelated pumpkin-spice news, the limited-edition Oreos of the flavor are apparently quite real. We\u2019ve officially reached Pumpkin Spice saturation point. pic.twitter.com/Tve77ov5JZ 3. No one expects \u201crecord-shattering snowfall\u201d this year. That claim \u2014 like so many others! \u2014 comes from the unfunny \u201csatirists\u201d at EmpireNews.net, increasingly our least favorite fake-news site in a generally unfavorable field. According to the story and its accompanying map, meteorologists have expected \u201cabove normal snowfall\u201d in huge swaths of the United States, including the entire mid-Atlantic coast. Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, it\u2019s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesn\u2019t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now. #InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having \u2033record shattering snowfall\u201d this winter. Lord Jesus. 4. \u201cMale birth control\u201d will probably not be here by 2017. A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a \u201cmale birth control\u201d injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the world\u2019s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that it\u2019s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 and neither of those things are true. \u201cThe news came from a press release \u2014 and call for donations! \u2014 by the foundation behind Vasalgel,\u201d Julia Belluz explained at Vox, \u201chighlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.\u201d Bottom line: It\u2019s great that someone\u2019s working on male birth control, but it\u2019s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017. 5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that \u201cALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.\u201d The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of \u201cupdates\u201d on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People \u201csaw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,\u201d one dispatcher said. \u201cIt\u2019s all rumor, it\u2019s all hearsay.\u201d Possible shooter in Camp Pendleton!? Anybody hear anything?? 6. Shakira is not dead. The singer\u2019s hips don\u2019t lie, but the Internet does. Constantly. A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained \u201cexclusive images and details\u201d from the scene. Colombia\u2019s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, she\u2019s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique. 7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved children\u2019s TV show. A comedian going by the name Zayn Sheikh outraged many Brits (and fooled a number of news outlets, British and otherwise) with a YouTube video that demanded the TV show \u201cPeppa Pig\u201d go off air and suggested a national campaign would soon organize for that purpose. Peppa Pig is a beloved, alliterative British cartoon character \u2014 and also \u201charam,\u201d or forbidden to Muslims, Sheikh claimed. Over the weekend, Sheikh posted a second video admitting the whole thing was a hoax \u2014 but a hoax for a cause. \u201cThis video served to show how much Islamophobia is around, for those who deny its existence,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is sad to live in a society where some feel that Muslims have no rights to talk at all.\u201d 8. Obama will not \u201cresign amid new Benghazi revelations.\u201d Every word of this headline is a dream come true to some of the president\u2019s more conspiracy-minded opponents, which perhaps explains why the fake article, from fake-article-generator National Report, went viral in those circles. As of this writing, it\u2019s been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. Even Donald Trump seems to have fallen for the \u201cjoke\u201d! If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country\u2014I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses! (Just kidding, that tweet is related to another matter entirely.) 9. Cocaine has not been found in Coors Light beer. Since this is the second widespread cocaine-in-a-beverage hoax in as many weeks, let\u2019s get a few things straight about the alleged phenomenon. First up: This hoax seems to do well because it has some remote, and long ago, bases in fact. (Cocaine-laced sodas and beverages were very popular in ye olden days, around the time of the Civil War.) It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull. That said, no cocaine expose published on a site called Huzlers.com is ever going to be real. Ever. How have 286,000 people shared this stupid thing? 10. The ruins of an ancient city were not discovered in the Australian desert. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this faux-story from World News Daily Report \u2014 besides the number of times people have reposted it to Facebook \u2014 is the amazingly credulous conversation readers are having in the comments section below it. \u201cI thought the climate in central Australia had been arid for over 30,000 years,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201c30,000 people living in the desert? That would require agriculture and irrigation \u2026 That\u2019s just incredible!\u201d Indeed. Did we miss any other notable fake stuff this week? E-mail caitlin.dewey@washpost.com \u2014 or stay tuned until next week, because surely some more shenanigans will go down in the meantime.", "label": "against"}

Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349, analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands. Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers \u2014 Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition \u2014 each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices. Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options. The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series. On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals. Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars. \"If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,\" Munster writes. He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band \u2014 assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 \u2014 the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600. The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year. Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event, as well as highlight \"special features\" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.

The drug-test rumor came from occasional pro golfer Dan Olsen, and was made on a Lansing, Mich., sports talk radio show on Friday morning. Who the hell is Dan Olsen? Good question!

It's a credible person who is telling me this.'' [+] EnlargeTiger Woods Sam Greenwood/Getty Images Both the PGA Tour and Tiger Woods' agent have emphatically denied claims that he has been suspended for a month by the Tour. Olsen, who played only one full season on the PGA Tour (2004), said an exempt tour player told him, but he would not disclose the player and couldn't say he fully believed him. He also told ESPN.com's Michael Collins on Monday that the information he got about the suspension was not first-hand. \"It's not testosterone, but it's something else,'' Olsen said. \"I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.'' Olsen also talked about Woods using a \"cheater ball,'' referring to the Nike golf ball he plays, and that those allegations were potentially more damaging than the suspension. \"I'll be looked at as just some crazy f--- nobody making accusations about Tiger,'' Olsen told ESPN.com. Ty Votaw, the executive vice president of the PGA Tour, denied any of the claims brought forth by Olsen.  \"There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,\" Votaw said. \"We categorically deny these allegations.'' The Tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters. Woods said on Feb. 11 that he was taking a break to deal with the issues in his game after withdrawing during the first round last month of the Farmers Insurance Open. \"Over the past year, Woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the 70 in the world. \"These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,'' said Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, in a statement. \"They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.'' If Woods failed a test for performance drugs, the PGA Tour has said it is required to announce a suspension. And it would undoubtedly be for more than a month. If he failed a test for some sort of recreational substance, the tour's policy is not to disclose any penalties. But if the transgression were severe, a month penalty would seem minor. \"They're not even going to remember the women,'' Olsen said, referring to the personal scandal Woods endured in 2009 which led to a divorce from his wife. \"The women are going to take a distance second place. You're gonna talk about him with Lance Armstrong.'' The PGA Tour began testing for performance enhancing drugs in 2008 and Woods has been randomly tested like other players. Only two players have run afoul of the drug testing guidelines and both were suspended for a year. Olsen tied for 12th at Tucson in 2004, one of only eight cuts that he made in 31 PGA Tour starts that season. He also played the Web.com Tour in 2006, finishing with two top-10s in 27 events.", "label": "against"}

Olsen\u2019s dislike for Tiger Woods must be really strong if he\u2019s going to go on radio and make wild claims that haven\u2019t been evidenced by anything or anyone else. As if this wild claim wasn\u2019t enough, Olsen went on to basically say that Tiger is just one big cheater and dragged Rory McIlroy into it. \u201cTiger, he\u2019s got some problems now,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cOne of the big problems, Nike\u2019s been giving Tiger a ball that I would almost bet hasn\u2019t been tested\u2026Rory played it too. Remember when Rory signed the Nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year? He was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too\u2026 So if you go to Tour events, Nike pays them, pays the Tour staff and the range staff, they pay them to get all those balls back. That\u2019s why Tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away\u2026 He played a ball that nobody else could play.\u201d Again, wow. Dan Olsen is going all in on Tiger Woods, staking his reputation (which obviously isn\u2019t much because most people have never heard of him) to call out Tiger as a cheater. It\u2019s a tough claim to believe, and one you don\u2019t want to believe, either. Tiger Woods is one of the best golfers to play the game and when he\u2019s done he\u2019ll be remembered as the best. Tiger has played two PGA Tour events this year and he missed the cut in Phoenix in January and withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open in early February after suffering back pain. Because of his back surgery last summer, I guess it wouldn\u2019t be shocking that Tiger would take PEDs, but IF he even has, they certainly haven\u2019t helped him at all. And Tiger is a veteran, he knows about drug testing and he\u2019s gone through it his whole career. The claims by Olsen, who has played in 35 PGA Tour events in his career with no top ten finishes, seem farfetched and forced, but you can\u2019t discount them completely. We\u2019ll see if this prompts Tiger Woods or the PGA of America to make a statement denying these facts or coming clean on something that may or may not be true.", "label": "observing"}

It prompted the Secret Service to erect a second fence about 12 feet further away from the White House than the permanent fence, creating second barrier that would-be fence jumpers would have to climb. Officials originally argued the reason agents didn't shoot the suspect, Omar Gonzalez, as he sprinted across the lawn or release guard dogs to detain him was because he appeared unarmed.

People jumping over the White House fence has become a more common occurrence, but most individuals are tackled by Secret Services officers guarding the complex before getting even a third of the way across the lawn. Gonzalez is the first person known to have jumped the fence and made it inside the executive mansion. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the breach was \u201cunacceptable\u201d to her, and on Friday she briefed President Obama on her plans to shore up security. Pierson is expected to face tough questions about the Gonzalez incident Tuesday at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The hearing is likely to cover a number of security lapses by the agency, including new revelations published over the weekend by The Washington Post about the failure to identify and properly investigate a 2011 shooting attack on the White House. The more detailed account of this month\u2019s security breach comes from people who provided information about the incident to The Washington Post and whistleblowers who contacted Rep. Jason Chaffetz, (R-Utah), chairman of a House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security. Chaffetz said he plans to ask Pierson how an alarm meant to alert officers to intruders could be silenced or turned down. The congressman said two people inside the agency told him that boxes were silenced because the White House usher staff, whose office is near the front door, complained they were noisy. A Secret Service official told The Post that the usher\u2019s office was concerned the boxes were frequently malfunctioning and unnecessarily sounding off. The alarm boxes, which officers call \u201ccrash boxes,\u201d are key pieces of the agency\u2019s first-alert system, according to former agents and officials. If they spot an intruder, officers are trained to hit the large red button on the nearest box \u2014 sending an alert to every post on the complex about the location of an incursion, and piping sound from that location to other boxes around the property. \u201cIf true, the fact that crash boxes were muted to avoid being \u2018disruptive\u2019 is not due to a lack of resources or an insufficient number of checkpoints or barriers,\u201d Chaffetz said. He called the incident a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d by the Secret Service. \u201cThe agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cIt must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.\u201d The new revelations follow accounts provided to The Post last week detailing how Gonzalez\u2019s ability to enter the White House reflected a failure of multiple levels of security around the compound. The agency relies on these successive layers as a fail-safe for protecting the president and the White House complex. In this incident, a plainclothes surveillance team was on duty that night outside the fence, meant to spot jumpers and give early warning before they made it over. When that team didn\u2019t notice Gonzalez, there was an officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. When that officer couldn\u2019t reach Gonzales, there was supposed to be an attack dog, a specialized SWAT team and a guard at the front door \u2014 all at the ready. The dog was not released, a decision now under review. Some people familiar with the incident say the handler likely felt he could not release the dog because so many officers were in pursuit of Gonzalez, and the dog may have attacked them instead. Since the incident, the Secret Service has added an additional layer of temporary fencing while the agency reviews its procedures. Alice Crites contributed to this report.
